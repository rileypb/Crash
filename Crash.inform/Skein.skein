Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after Space Marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you forward.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Welcome to Crash by Phil Riley. There are a few things about this game you may want to be aware of.

Text adventures (also known as interactive fiction) have a number of conventions and common commands. Some are:

Move by entering the direction you want to travel. You can use abbreviations, such as "n" for "north" and "u" for "up". 

 - look (or l): prints a description of your surroundings.
 - take &lt;something&gt;: moves something from your surroundings to your person.
 - drop &lt;something&gt;: opposite of take.
 - sit on &lt;something&gt;, get up: what they sound like.
 - examine &lt;something&gt; (or x): get a more detailed description (sometimes) of something.
 - unlock &lt;something&gt; with &lt;something&gt;, open &lt;something&gt;
 - press &lt;a button&gt;
 - inventory (or i): list what the player is carrying.
 - wait (or z): pass one turn doing nothing.


If there's something else you'd like to try, type it in and see what happens!

You can ask for hints at any time by typing "hints". Note that the available hints will vary from time to time, and there may not be any hints available when you ask.

There are a few ways in which this game differs from many text adventures:

First, we use nautical directions: fore, aft, port, starboard, up, down, in, and out. ("f", "a", "p", "s", "u", "d", "in", and "out")

Fore is the direction towards the front of the ship, that is, the usual direction of travel. Aft is the opposite of fore. Port is the direction to your left when you're facing fore. Starboard is the opposite of port. You can remember port from starboard by remembering that "port" and "left" have the same number of letters.

Up and down are relative to the shipboard artificial gravity. This gravity doesn't extend beyond the hull. Instead, outside we have the radial directions in (toward the center of mass of the ship) and out (away from the center of mass).

Second, two new commands: 

 - clean &lt;something&gt; or dust &lt;something&gt;: you're a cleaner, you need to be able to clean.
 - slide &lt;something&gt; through &lt;a card slot&gt;: some of the doors in the game require access cards.

To turn on accessibility features, use "accessible on". To turn them off again, use "accessible off".

You can also get help talking to other characters with "help speech".

You come to your senses lying on a bunk, not quite sure how you got here. You seem to have lost your equipment.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

You slide the maintenance crew access card through the slot. The Captain's door slides smoothly open. A pleasant ping indicates it now recognizes you as authorized.

&gt;[21] a
The Captain's door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

&gt;[27] put magazine in strange device
You insert the copy of Stars Magazine into the strange device, and the screen lights up. It looks like the copy of Stars Magazine, only translated into Standard Galactic.

The cover of Stars Magazine teases an issue full of Space Authority news exclusives, celebrity gossip, and useful space safety tips. It features a picture of a Space Marine spacewalking in a vac suit.

The galactic translator boasts a left button, a right button, and a small button next to a thin slot.

&gt;[28] press right button
The galactic translator flips forward a page.

Page 1 of Stars Magazine is a discussion of the political status of the separatist movement on Deneb IV. Booring.

The galactic translator flips forward a page.

Page 4 of Stars Magazine is the astrology section. Apparently this month you will face an unanticipated challenge.

The galactic translator boasts a left button, a right button, and a small button next to a thin slot.

&gt;[32] press right button
The galactic translator flips forward a page.

Page 5 doesn't contain much of interest, just gossip and the occasional lifestyle piece.

The galactic translator boasts a left button, a right button, and a small button next to a thin slot.

&gt;[33] press right button
The galactic translator flips forward a page.

Page 6 of Stars Magazine is a tutorial in vac suit operation for the non-technical. It details all kinds of important aspects of the suit, including:

* How to take the suit on and off.
 * How to activate the suit: "Suit, activation code &lt;code&gt;"
 * The automatic pressurization system.
 * How to operate the mag boots: "Suit, mag boots on", "Suit, mag boots off".
 * Keeping an eye on the oxygen level: "Suit, report oxygen level".
 * Monitoring suit status: "Suit, report status".
 * How to look good while wearing the vac suit.

The article strongly emphasizes that a typical vac suit does not contain a propulsion system, so care must be taken not to be spun off into deep space.

Someone has scribbled 247018 in the margin of the page.

You wait several seconds for the chamber to depressurize. You hear a series of three beeps indicating the chamber is now in vacuum.

The vac suit has failed to pressurize. You stumble and flail, unable to do anything to save yourself. What a shame.

You are in the Engineering airlock chamber. You're one door away from the great void of space. Both doors are closed; you'll have to open one to leave the airlock.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The engineering airlock inner door is closed.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The engineering airlock inner door is closed.

The engineering airlock outer door is closed.

You come to your senses lying on a bunk, not quite sure how you got here. You seem to have lost your equipment.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

[Ohh my head hurts. What the heck happened? Better get back to the station pronto.]

&gt;[19] slide card through slot
You slide the maintenance crew access card through the slot. The Captain's door slides smoothly open. A pleasant ping indicates it now recognizes you as authorized.

&gt;[20] a
The Captain's door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

[Not my kind of reading, actually, but what the heck.]Taken.

&gt;[26] put magazine in strange device
You insert the copy of Stars Magazine into the strange device, and the screen lights up. It looks like the copy of Stars Magazine, only translated into Standard Galactic.

The cover of Stars Magazine teases an issue full of Space Authority news exclusives, celebrity gossip, and useful space safety tips. It features a picture of a Space Marine spacewalking in a vac suit.

The galactic translator boasts a left button, a right button, and a small button next to a thin slot.

Page 6 of Stars Magazine is a tutorial in vac suit operation for the non-technical. It details all kinds of important aspects of the suit, including:

* How to take the suit on and off.
 * How to activate the suit: "Suit, activation code &lt;code&gt;"
 * The automatic pressurization system.
 * How to operate the mag boots: "Suit, mag boots on", "Suit, mag boots off".
 * Keeping an eye on the oxygen level: "Suit, report oxygen level".
 * Monitoring suit status: "Suit, report status".
 * How to look good while wearing the vac suit.

The article strongly emphasizes that a typical vac suit does not contain a propulsion system, so care must be taken not to be spun off into deep space.

Someone has scribbled 247018 in the margin of the page.

Aft Airlock Chamber
You are in the aft airlock chamber. You're one door away from the great void of space. You can go forward into the ship.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

You wait several seconds for the chamber to depressurize. You hear a series of three beeps indicating the chamber is now in vacuum.

The vac suit has failed to pressurize. You stumble and flail, unable to do anything to save yourself. What a shame.

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after Space Marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Pvt "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

You pass through the aft airlock and into the ship, closing the airlock doors behind you.

Aft Entry
You are forward from the aft airlock, inside the ship. Beyond the airlock is the station gangway.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The airlock is aft of here, and a ladder leads up to the ship proper.

The aft airlock inner door is closed.

Crew Quarters
This is a busy junction when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew bunks, aft is the door to the captain's quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the aft airlock.

Somehow you're okay. Inertial dampers must have kicked in. Nevertheless, you feel like you were hit by a truck.
But what happened?

You come to your senses lying on a bunk, not quite sure how you got here. You seem to have lost your equipment.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

[Ohh my head hurts. What the heck happened? Better get back to the station pronto.]

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

Aft Airlock Chamber
You are in the aft airlock chamber. You're one door away from the great void of space. You can go forward into the ship.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions.

The aft airlock outer door is open.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[56] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so you'll have to do it without the help of your mag boots.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after space marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Private "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after space marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Private "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after space marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Private "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

confusion...

Somehow you're okay. Inertial dampers must have kicked in. Nevertheless, you feel like you were hit by a truck.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

[Ohh my head hurts. What the heck happened? Better get back to the station pronto.]

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after space marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Private "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

Aft Entry
You are forward from the aft airlock, inside the ship. Beyond the airlock is the station gangway.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The airlock is aft of here, and a ladder leads up to the ship proper.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

This is a busy junction when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew bunks, aft is the door to the captain's quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the aft airlock.

&gt;[25] s

Starboard-Side Bunks
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to port.

A copy of Stars Magazine is just peeking from underneath the left bottom bunk.

&gt;[26] take magazine
[Not my kind of reading, actually, but what the heck.]Taken.

&gt;[27] put magazine in strange device
You insert the copy of Stars Magazine into the strange device, and the screen lights up. It looks like the copy of Stars Magazine, only translated into Standard Galactic.

The cover of Stars Magazine teases an issue full of Space Authority news exclusives, celebrity gossip, and useful space safety tips. It features a picture of a Space Marine spacewalking in a vac suit.

The galactic translator boasts a left button, a right button, and a small button next to a thin slot.

&gt;[28] press right button
The galactic translator flips forward a page.

Page 1 of Stars Magazine is a discussion of the political status of the separatist movement on Deneb IV. Booring.

&gt;[33] press right button

Page 6 of Stars Magazine is a tutorial in vac suit operation for the non-technical. It details all kinds of important aspects of the suit, including:

* How to take the suit on and off.
 * How to activate the suit: "Suit, activation code &lt;code&gt;"
 * The automatic pressurization system.
 * How to operate the mag boots: "Suit, mag boots on", "Suit, mag boots off".
 * Keeping an eye on the oxygen level: "Suit, report oxygen level".
 * Monitoring suit status: "Suit, report status".
 * How to look good while wearing the vac suit.

The article strongly emphasizes that a typical vac suit does not contain a propulsion system, so care must be taken not to be spun off into deep space.

Someone has scribbled 247018 in the margin of the page.

Crew Quarters

Aft Entry
You are forward from the aft airlock, inside the ship. Outside is empty space where you're used to seeing the station gangway. Far off you see the luminous embers of what might have been an explosion.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The airlock is aft of here, and a ladder leads up to the ship proper.

The aft airlock inner door is closed.

&gt;[52] press red button
The inner door of the airlock slides open.

&gt;[53] a

Aft Airlock Chamber
You are in the aft airlock chamber. You're one door away from the great void of space. You can go forward into the ship.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The aft airlock inner door is open.

The aft airlock outer door is closed.

&gt;[54] press red button
The inner door of the airlock slides closed.

&gt;[55] press yellow button
You wait several seconds for the chamber to depressurize. You hear a series of three beeps indicating the chamber is now in vacuum.

The vac suit has failed to pressurize. You stumble and flail, unable to do anything to save yourself. What a shame.

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after space marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Private "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

You pass through the aft airlock and into the ship, closing the airlock doors behind you.

Aft Entry
You are forward from the aft airlock, inside the ship. Beyond the airlock is the station gangway.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The airlock is aft of here, and a ladder leads up to the ship proper.

The aft airlock inner door is closed.

Crew Quarters
This is a busy junction when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew bunks, aft is the door to the captain's quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the aft airlock.

⇒ You can ask for hints at any time by typing "hints".

BOOM -- suddenly everything goes to hell. A bulkhead seems to hurtle towards you...
pain...
confusion...
blackness...
Somehow you're okay. Inertial dampers must have kicked in. Nevertheless, you feel like you were hit by a truck.
But what happened?

Crash
An Interactive Fiction by Phil Riley

You come to your senses lying on a bunk, not quite sure how you got here. You seem to have lost your equipment.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

[Ohh my head hurts. What the heck happened? Better get back to the station pronto.]

You get off the right bottom bunk.

&gt;[15] put maintenance card in door
You slide the maintenance crew access card through the slot. The door buzzes three times, indicating the card is unreadable.
[I don't understand. The card worked earlier today.]

It's not clear how to do that with the extendable dusting device.

Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

Tip: Use "substance &gt; input" to set each input. For instance, "Un &gt; 3" sets input 3 to Unobtainium. You may also use "set &lt;input&gt; to &lt;substance&gt;" for the same effect. Use "disconnect &lt;input&gt;" to disconnect an input.

Near the console is a large cabinet with a card slot. It is closed.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions.

The aft airlock outer door is open.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so you'll have to do it without the help of your mag boots.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after space marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Private "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

Near the console is a large cabinet with a card slot. It is closed.

An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing.

Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after space marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Private "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

Near the console is a large cabinet with a card slot. It is closed.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The engineering airlock inner door is closed.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

The desk drawer is open and empty.

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after Space Marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Pvt "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

You pass through the aft airlock and into the ship, closing the airlock doors behind you.

Aft Entry
You are forward from the aft airlock, inside the ship. Beyond the airlock is the station gangway.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The airlock is aft of here, and a ladder leads up to the ship proper.

The aft airlock inner door is closed.

BOOM -- suddenly everything goes to hell. A bulkhead seems to hurtle towards you...
pain...

Somehow you're okay. Inertial dampers must have kicked in. Nevertheless, you feel like you were hit by a truck.
But what happened?

You come to your senses lying on a bunk, not quite sure how you got here. You seem to have lost your equipment.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

Starboard-Side Bunks
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to port.

On the left bottom bunk is a OnePass.

A copy of Stars Magazine is just peeking from underneath the left bottom bunk.

&gt;[2] take onepass
Taken.

&gt;[3] slide onepass in slot
You can't see any such thing.

[Purloined.]

The OnePass swallows up the military ID card. It is now available when using the OnePass.

[Purloined.]

You pass through the aft airlock and into the ship, closing the airlock doors behind you.

Aft Entry
You are forward from the aft airlock, inside the ship. Beyond the airlock is the station gangway.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The airlock is aft of here, and a ladder leads up to the ship proper.

The aft airlock inner door is closed.

You come to your senses lying on a bunk, not quite sure how you got here. You seem to have lost your equipment.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

[Ohh my head hurts. What the heck happened? Better get back to the station pronto.]

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions.

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so you'll have to do it without the help of your mag boots.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after space marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Private "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

Starboard-Side Bunks
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to port.

On the left bottom bunk is a OnePass.

A copy of Stars Magazine is just peeking from underneath the left bottom bunk.

Insert your cards in this part here, and swipe this part just like a card! 

[These things are great. You just put all your access cards in it, and then use it as a card instead.]

A little readout on the side of the OnePass says "No cards stored."

You come to your senses lying on a bunk, not quite sure how you got here. You seem to have lost your equipment.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

[Ohh my head hurts. What the heck happened? Better get back to the station pronto.]

Time passes.

&gt;[8] get up
You get off the right bottom bunk.

Aft Entry
You are forward from the aft airlock, inside the ship. Outside is empty space where you're used to seeing the station gangway. Far off you see the luminous embers of what might have been an explosion.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

&gt;[18] a
The Captain's door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

Aft Airlock Chamber
You are in the aft airlock chamber. You're one door away from the great void of space. You can go forward into the ship.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions.

The aft airlock outer door is open.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so you'll have to do it without the help of your mag boots.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the fore/aft door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the fore/aft door.

The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the Fore/Aft door, blocking it.

You can also see an extendable dusting device, a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner, a sonic decontaminator, and a maintenance crew access card here.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

Near the console is a large cabinet with a card slot. It is closed.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The engineering airlock inner door is closed.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

You hear someone speaking forward of here.

Engine Room
Though no engines are actually in this room, it is where the combustion process is controlled. Monitoring electronics and controls cover the walls. A wide doorway opens forward to the Engineering Deck, and small portals to port and starboard provide access to the two engine chambers. The main engine, which drives the two side engines, is beyond the aft wall.

There is a large diagram of the fuel injection process on the aft wall. There is a large button below the diagram labeled "Test".

        <result xml:space="preserve">Welcome to Crash by Phil Riley. There are a few things about this game you may want to be aware of.

Text adventures (also known as interactive fiction) have a number of conventions and common commands. Some are:

Move by entering the direction you want to travel. You can use abbreviations, such as "n" for "north" and "u" for "up". 

 - look (or l): prints a description of your surroundings.
 - take &lt;something&gt;: moves something from your surroundings to your person.
 - drop &lt;something&gt;: opposite of take.
 - sit on &lt;something&gt;, get up: what they sound like.
 - examine &lt;something&gt; (or x): get a more detailed description (sometimes) of something.
 - unlock &lt;something&gt; with &lt;something&gt;, open &lt;something&gt;
 - press &lt;a button&gt;
 - inventory (or i): list what the player is carrying.
 - wait (or z): pass one turn doing nothing.


If there's something else you'd like to try, type it in and see what happens!

You can ask for hints at any time by typing "hints". Note that the available hints will vary from time to time, and there may not be any hints available when you ask.

There are a few ways in which this game differs from many text adventures:

First, we use nautical directions: fore, aft, port, starboard, up, down, in, and out. ("f", "a", "p", "s", "u", "d", "in", and "out")

Fore is the direction towards the front of the ship, that is, the usual direction of travel. Aft is the opposite of fore. Port is the direction to your left when you're facing fore. Starboard is the opposite of port. You can remember port from starboard by remembering that "port" and "left" have the same number of letters.

Up and down are relative to the shipboard artificial gravity. This gravity doesn't extend beyond the hull. Instead, outside we have the radial directions in (toward the center of mass of the ship) and out (away from the center of mass).

Second, two new commands: 

 - clean &lt;something&gt; or dust &lt;something&gt;: you're a cleaner, you need to be able to clean.
 - slide &lt;something&gt; through &lt;a card slot&gt;: some of the doors in the game require access cards.

To turn on accessibility features, use "accessible on". To turn them off again, use "accessible off".

You can also get help talking to other characters with "help speech".
 
And finally, [text that looks like this] is the main character's, i.e., your, thoughts.

        <result xml:space="preserve">There are a few commands that allow you to talk to other characters you meet. These are: 

 - hello: to start talking to someone.
 - ask &lt;someone&gt; about &lt;something&gt;: ask the character to tell you what it knows about a thing.
 - goodbye: to stop talking to someone.
 - tell &lt;someone&gt; about &lt;something&gt;: tell the character what you know about a thing.
 - yes
 - no

Note: you cannot talk or ask about a subject with which you are unfamiliar. Thus you cannot get an answer to "ask Frank about Sophie" unless you are aware of Sophie's existence.

To ask a person or thing to do something use the following pattern: "&lt;name&gt;, &lt;action&gt;", for instance, "computer, help."

One useful command is "&lt;name&gt;, repeat", which will cause the named person or thing to repeat the last thing they said, if anything.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

Starboard-Side Bunks
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to port.

On the left bottom bunk is a OnePass.

A copy of Stars Magazine is just peeking from underneath the left bottom bunk.

&gt;[2] take onepass
Taken.

&gt;[3] slide onepass in slot
A light on the locker flashes red.

 - hello: to start talking to someone.
 - ask &lt;someone&gt; about &lt;something&gt;: ask the character to tell you what it knows about a thing.
 - goodbye: to stop talking to someone.
 - tell &lt;someone&gt; about &lt;something&gt;: tell the character what you know about a thing.
 - yes

Note: you cannot talk or ask about a subject with which you are unfamiliar. Thus you cannot get an answer to "ask Frank about Sophie" unless you are aware of Sophie's existence.

To ask a person or thing to do something use the following pattern: "&lt;name&gt;, &lt;action&gt;", for instance, "computer, help."

One useful command is "&lt;name&gt;, repeat", which will cause the named person or thing to repeat the last thing they said, if anything.

Crew Quarters
This is a busy junction when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew bunks, aft is the door to the captain's quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the aft airlock.

⇒ You can ask for hints at any time by typing "hints".

BOOM -- suddenly everything goes to hell. A bulkhead seems to hurtle towards you...
pain...
confusion...
blackness...
Somehow you're okay. Inertial dampers must have kicked in. Nevertheless, you feel like you were hit by a truck.
But what happened?

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

[Ohh my head hurts. What the heck happened? Better get back to the station pronto.]

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

Page 6 of Stars Magazine is a tutorial in vac suit operation for the non-technical. It details all kinds of important aspects of the suit, including: 

 - "Suit, help"
 - How to take the suit on and off.
 - How to activate the suit: "Suit, activation code &lt;code&gt;"
 - The automatic pressurization system.
 - How to operate the mag boots: "Suit, mag boots on", "Suit, mag boots off".
 - Monitoring suit status: "Suit, report status".
 - How to look good while wearing the vac suit.

The article strongly emphasizes that a typical vac suit does not contain a propulsion system, so care must be taken not to be spun off into deep space.

An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a computer terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the computer terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls, communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the Fore/Aft door, blocking it.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

        <result xml:space="preserve">(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, how am I going to tell whom to trust?]

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after Space Marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Pvt "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

Port-Side Bunks
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right bottom bunk is a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device.

You can also see a sonic decontaminator here.

[Standing up makes me a little dizzy, oh my.]

[Okay now, back to the station -- let's see, I'm in Port-Side Bunks, so I need to go starboard and then down...]

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The aft airlock inner door is closed.

The aft airlock outer door is closed.

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after space marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Private "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Where am I?]

&gt;[4] s
[What? Didn't get that. My brain is spinning too much. Try again.]

&gt;[5] z

[Everything's a bit fuzzy.]

&gt;[6] z
You come to your senses lying on a bunk, not quite sure how you got here. You seem to have lost your equipment.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

[Ohh my head hurts. What the heck happened? Better get back to the station pronto.]

&gt;[7] z
Time passes.

&gt;[8] get up
You get off the right bottom bunk.

Crew Quarters
This is a busy junction when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew bunks, aft is the door to the captain's quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the aft airlock.

&gt;[11] d

Aft Entry
You are forward from the aft airlock, inside the ship. Outside is empty space where you're used to seeing the station gangway. Far off you see the luminous embers of what might have been an explosion.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The airlock is aft of here, and a ladder leads up to the ship proper.

The aft airlock inner door is closed.

[Holy... the station -- it's gone? Where the hell am I? What am I going to do?]

The Captain's door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

&gt;[19] open desk
(the captain's desk)
You open the desk drawer, revealing a steel key and a strange gadget.

&gt;[20] take all from drawer

This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to port.

On the left bottom bunk is a OnePass.

A copy of Stars Magazine is just peeking from underneath the left bottom bunk.

&gt;[23] take magazine
[Not my kind of reading, actually, but what the heck.]Taken.

Aft Airlock Chamber
You are in the aft airlock chamber. You're one door away from the great void of space. You can go forward into the ship.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The aft airlock inner door is open.

The aft airlock outer door is closed.

&gt;[51] press red button
The inner door of the airlock slides closed.

&gt;[52] press yellow button
You wait several seconds for the chamber to depressurize. You hear a series of three beeps indicating the chamber is now in vacuum.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[53] press blue button
The outer door of the airlock slides open.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[54] suit, mag boots on
A pleasant voice says, "Mag boots activated."

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[55] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions.

The aft airlock outer door is open.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[56] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so you'll have to do it without the help of your mag boots.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

Some commands special to this game: 

 - activate suit - magically activate the vac suit without doing the real work
 - familiar &lt;something&gt; - magically learn about a thing so that you can talk to people about it; normally you can't talk about something you're not familiar with
 - show all hints - allow access to all hints, before they'd ordinarily become available

There are a few commands that are spoilers in and of themselves. To see them, enter "help test spoilers". It's probably inadvisable to look at them until you've gone really deep into the game.

        <result xml:space="preserve">Welcome to Crash by Phil Riley. There are a few things about this game you may want to be aware of.

Text adventures (also known as interactive fiction) have a number of conventions and common commands. Some are:

Move by entering the direction you want to travel. You can use abbreviations, such as "n" for "north" and "u" for "up". 

 - look (or l): prints a description of your surroundings.
 - take &lt;something&gt;: moves something from your surroundings to your person.
 - drop &lt;something&gt;: opposite of take.
 - sit on &lt;something&gt;, get up: what they sound like.
 - examine &lt;something&gt; (or x): get a more detailed description (sometimes) of something.
 - unlock &lt;something&gt; with &lt;something&gt;, open &lt;something&gt;
 - press &lt;a button&gt;
 - inventory (or i): list what the player is carrying.
 - wait (or z): pass one turn doing nothing.


If there's something else you'd like to try, type it in and see what happens!

You can ask for hints at any time by typing "hints". Note that the available hints will vary from time to time, and there may not be any hints available when you ask.

There are a few ways in which this game differs from many text adventures:

First, we use nautical directions: fore, aft, port, starboard, up, down, in, and out. ("f", "a", "p", "s", "u", "d", "in", and "out")

Fore is the direction towards the front of the ship, that is, the usual direction of travel. Aft is the opposite of fore. Port is the direction to your left when you're facing fore. Starboard is the opposite of port. You can remember port from starboard by remembering that "port" and "left" have the same number of letters.

Up and down are relative to the shipboard artificial gravity. This gravity doesn't extend beyond the hull. Instead, outside we have the radial directions in (toward the center of mass of the ship) and out (away from the center of mass).

Second, two new commands: 

 - clean &lt;something&gt; or dust &lt;something&gt;: you're a cleaner, you need to be able to clean.
 - slide &lt;something&gt; through &lt;a card slot&gt;: some of the doors in the game require access cards.

In part of the game, we use ASCII art to represent what's going on. If you'd like to turn this art off, use "ASCII off". You can turn it on again using "ASCII on".

And finally, [text that looks like this] is the main character's, i.e., your, thoughts.

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after Space Marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Pvt "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

Crew Quarters
This is a busy junction when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew bunks, aft is the door to the captain's quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the aft airlock.

⇒ You can ask for hints at any time by typing "hints".

BOOM -- suddenly everything goes to hell. A bulkhead seems to hurtle towards you...
pain...
confusion...
blackness...
Somehow you're okay. Inertial dampers must have kicked in. Nevertheless, you feel like you were hit by a truck.
But what happened?

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after Space Marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Pvt "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

Operations
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls, communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the Fore/Aft door, blocking it.

You can also see an extendable dusting device, a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner, a sonic decontaminator, and a maintenance crew access card here.

BOOM -- suddenly everything goes to hell. A bulkhead seems to hurtle towards you...

confusion...
blackness...
Somehow you're okay. Inertial dampers must have kicked in. Nevertheless, you feel like you were hit by a truck.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

Page 6 of Stars Magazine is a tutorial in vac suit operation for the non-technical. It details all kinds of important aspects of the suit, including: 

 - How to take the suit on and off.
 - How to activate the suit: "Suit, activation code &lt;code&gt;"
 - The automatic pressurization system.
 - How to operate the mag boots: "Suit, mag boots on", "Suit, mag boots off".
 - Keeping an eye on the oxygen level: "Suit, report oxygen level".
 - Monitoring suit status: "Suit, report status".
 - How to look good while wearing the vac suit.

The article strongly emphasizes that a typical vac suit does not contain a propulsion system, so care must be taken not to be spun off into deep space.

Someone has scribbled 1 in the margin of the page.

You pass through the aft airlock and into the ship, closing the airlock doors behind you.

Aft Entry
You are forward from the aft airlock, inside the ship. Beyond the airlock is the station gangway.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The airlock is aft of here, and a ladder leads up to the ship proper.

The aft airlock inner door is closed.

&gt;[2] u

Crew Quarters
This is a busy junction when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew bunks, aft is the door to the captain's quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the aft airlock.

⇒ You can ask for hints at any time by typing "hints".

BOOM -- suddenly everything goes to hell. A bulkhead seems to hurtle towards you...
pain...
confusion...
blackness...
Somehow you're okay. Inertial dampers must have kicked in. Nevertheless, you feel like you were hit by a truck.
But what happened?

Crash
An Interactive Fiction by Phil Riley

[Everything's a bit fuzzy.]

&gt;[5] z
You come to your senses lying on a bunk, not quite sure how you got here. You seem to have lost your equipment.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

[Ohh my head hurts. What the heck happened? Better get back to the station pronto.]

&gt;[6] get up
You get off the right bottom bunk.

Port-Side Bunks
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room.

You can also see a sonic decontaminator here.

[Standing up makes me a little dizzy, oh my.]

[Okay now, back to the station -- let's see, I'm in Port-Side Bunks, so I need to go starboard and then down...]

&gt;[7] take all

Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

⇒ You may talk to the ship computer through the data terminal. You might try "computer, help" to get help on talking to the computer.

Port-Side Bunks
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

Page 6 of Stars Magazine is a tutorial in vac suit operation for the non-technical. It details all kinds of important aspects of the suit, including:

* How to take the suit on and off.
 * How to activate the suit: "Suit, activation code &lt;code&gt;"
 * The automatic pressurization system.
 * How to operate the mag boots: "Suit, mag boots on", "Suit, mag boots off".
 * Keeping an eye on the oxygen level: "Suit, report oxygen level".
 * Monitoring suit status: "Suit, report status".
 * How to look good while wearing the vac suit.

The article strongly emphasizes that a typical vac suit does not contain a propulsion system, so care must be taken not to be spun off into deep space.

Someone has scribbled 1 in the margin of the page.

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after Space Marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Pvt "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

To the fore is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on, I guess], you think.

You pass through the aft airlock and into the ship, closing the airlock doors behind you.

Aft Entry
You are forward from the aft airlock, inside the ship. Beyond the airlock is the station gangway.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The airlock is aft of here, and a ladder leads up to the ship proper.

The aft airlock inner door is closed.

BOOM -- suddenly everything goes to hell. A bulkhead seems to hurtle towards you...
pain...
confusion...
blackness...
Somehow you're okay. Inertial dampers must have kicked in. Nevertheless, you feel like you were hit by a truck.
But what happened?

You come to your senses lying on a bunk, not quite sure how you got here. You seem to have lost your equipment.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions.

The aft airlock outer door is open.

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so you'll have to do it without the help of your mag boots.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull.  It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so you'll have to do it without the help of your mag boots.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you the safety of home, before you the promise of adventure... cleaning up after space marines. Such is the lot of the 95th Sanitation Division. Not what you dreamed of when you enlisted.

As is usual, the crew is all off the ship while you board to clean it. You usually have a partner, but today Private "Chubby" Franks has the flu, so it's your job alone.

You pass through the aft airlock and into the ship, closing the airlock doors behind you.

Aft Entry
You are forward from the aft airlock, inside the ship. Beyond the airlock is the station gangway.

On your right is a control panel for the airlock. It consists of a green button to pressurize the airlock chamber, a yellow button to depressurize it, a red button to open and close the inner airlock door, and a blue button to open and close the outer airlock door.

The airlock is aft of here, and a ladder leads up to the ship proper.

The aft airlock inner door is closed.

&gt;[2] u

Crew Quarters
This is a busy junction when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew bunks, aft is the door to the captain's quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the aft airlock.

⇒ You can ask for hints at any time by typing "hints".

BOOM -- suddenly everything goes to hell. A bulkhead seems to hurtle towards you...
pain...
confusion...
blackness...
Somehow you're okay. Inertial dampers must have kicked in. Nevertheless, you feel like you were hit by a truck.
But what happened?

[Everything's a bit fuzzy.]

&gt;[5] z
You come to your senses lying on a bunk, not quite sure how you got here. You seem to have lost your equipment.

Port-Side Bunks (on the right bottom bunk)
[Okay, now things are coming into focus.]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to starboard.

Something is affixed to the wall by the top left bunk.

A leather wallet lies discarded on the ground.

On the right top bunk is an extendable dusting device [that's mine].

You can also see a sonic decontaminator [also mine] here.

On the right bottom bunk you can see a hand-held micro-compressing vacuum cleaner [mine again. I really took a tumble.].

[Ohh my head hurts. What the heck happened? Better get back to the station pronto.]

&gt;[6] get up
You get off the right bottom bunk.

Port-Side Bunks

An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. There is a data terminal on the desk. Against a third wall is the captain's one indulgence: a set of free weights neatly put away in racks. You can exit to fore.

You can see a 9kg weight, a 15kg weight, a 29kg weight, a 32kg weight, and a 50kg weight here.

Starboard-Side Bunks
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps four in two sets of bunks, one on the left and one on the right, all done up with military precision. There is a large locker here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. The sole exit is to port.

On the left bottom bunk is a OnePass.

A copy of Stars Magazine is just peeking from underneath the left bottom bunk.
