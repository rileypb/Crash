The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship.

This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You faintly hear someone speaking above.

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

In that game you scored 2 out of a possible 10, in 211 turns.

Your death was completely pointless and preventable. All the same we grudgingly award you one point each for what you did accomplish, which was:
- fixing the equipment cabinet in the starboard-side crew quarters
- fixing the aft airlock door

Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

The Delphi Engine Controls Aleph-Null is a fuel injection controller. It controls the process by which different substances are combined to produce the desired fuel. Since many fuels, such as Liquid Copernicium, have short half-lives, they must be produced shortly before use. Hence the necessity of the fuel injection controller.

Classified personnel data on Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax: Master Sergeant Arvax has had a distinguished career in the Space Marines, but has come under scrutiny in recent years for alleged sympathies with separatist factions on Deneb IV. Military Intelligence has so far declined to move on Arvax, but urges commanding officers to exercise discretion in their dealings with him, and to remain vigilant for any suspicious behavior.

Captain Mulgrew: "We hear you, Usagi, please respond."

Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

Captain Mulgrew is one of the most decorated captains in the Deneb sector. She was the second-youngest graduate of the Orion Marine Academy. She received command of the SS Usagi after successfully leading the retaking of the capital of Pollux VI from Irion invaders from the moon of Pollux III.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

You can see a cardboard box (empty), some wrapping paper, and a sticky note here.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

This where the combustion process is controlled. The aft wall is dominated by the operating panel of the fusion engine. Monitoring electronics and controls cover the other two walls. A doorway opens forward to the Engineering Deck.

Void Matter is essentially vacuum condensed into matter, according to the most comprehensible description we could find. It is an extremely unstable substance, and tends to explode catastrophically in the presence of high levels of energy. It can be created by injecting one source of tachyon crystals into another source of tachyon crystals.

Rather than containing or being formed of tachyons, tachyon crystals get their name from their use in detecting tachyons, due to their negative refractive index. The typical method of creating tachyon crystals is injecting Anti-Helium into Red Matter. Tachyon Crystals can be used in the creation of Void Matter.

    *** You saved New Da Nang, but lost the ship. ***


In that game you scored 4 out of a possible 10, in 316 turns.

Hooray for saving New Da Nang! The Space Marine leadership is less happy about losing the SS Usagi. But here's your score breakdown. You get one point each for:
- fixing the equipment cabinet in the starboard-side crew quarters
- fixing the aft airlock door

You also get a point for saving yourself, and a point for saving New Da Nang! Congratulations!
