Crash
An Interactive Disaster by Phil Riley
Release 17 / Serial number 221017 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[6] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[7] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship. It has chewing gum stuck to it.


[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

&gt;[8] a
You try to enter the airlock, but the automatic door fails to open for you.
[It's always just opened in the past.]

You add an item ("fix the airlock door") to your to-do list.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[9] u

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

⇒ You can enter "hints" at any time for help in progressing in the game.
&gt;[10] s

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[11] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[12] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters

There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

You can also see a black trunk (closed) here.

&gt;[13] get trunk
Taken.

&gt;[14] open it
You open the black trunk, revealing a present.

&gt;[15] take present
Taken.

&gt;[16] open it
[I'll go to hell for this, but here goes...]

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[17] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

&gt;[20] drop trunk
You place the black trunk near the airlock door.

&gt;[21] stand on trunk
(first closing the black trunk)
You get onto the black trunk.

&gt;[22] take broken sensor
You remove the broken sensor from the panel.

&gt;[23] put optical sensor in panel
You insert the fresh sensor into the empty socket.
[There. That should do it.]

You cross out an item ("fix the airlock door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[24] take suit
Taken.

&gt;[25] wear it
You put on the vac suit.

&gt;[26] turn on mag boots
You switch the Magnetic boots on.

(first getting off the black trunk)

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the blackness of space, speckled with the dying embers of what was once Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

&gt;[28] out
It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.
&gt;[29] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[30] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[31] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[32] vent air
You vent a bit of air from your suit. It propels you just a tiny amount toward the hull, but it's enough. One agonizing minute later, you're attached to the hull again.

[Oh thank god! I thought I was a goner.]

&gt;[34] in
Welcome back, visitor. I hope your spacewalk was uneventful.

Engineering Airlock
You are in the engineering airlock. Outside, the space to starboard looks so empty and peaceful it's hard to imagine the awful sight astern.

⇒ astern: behind or toward the rear of a ship, spaceship or aircraft.
&gt;[35] p

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

&gt;[36] sit in recharger
The nozzles on either side of the chair connect with the suit. After a few moments, the machine emits a pleasant "ping", the nozzles retract, and you stand up.

&gt;[37] p

Machine Room
The machine room is where the physical work of Engineering takes place; for instance, machining new parts. There is a large counter lined with drawers here, as well as numerous saws, drills, and other pieces of equipment. You can leave to starboard.

There's a hand vac sitting on the counter.

&gt;[38] open drawer
You open the machine room drawers, revealing a small key, a roll of electrical tape, a hex-shaped tool, and a fresh fuse.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[39] take all
portable hand-held vacuum cleaner: Taken.
small key: Taken.
roll of electrical tape: Taken.
hex-shaped tool: Taken.

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the midship door, blocking it.

&gt;[42] move trunk
You push the trunk clear of the door.

A man's voice comes over comms: "SS Usagi, come in! Is anyone there?"

[Finally, another person! I'm saved!]

⇒ By the way... you can get help about speaking to other characters by typing "help speech".
&gt;[43] set gravity control to 1
You dial the gravity to 1.

&gt;[44] press button
The door slides open.

A man's voice comes over comms: "Come in, Usagi, Come in, Usagi."

⇒ You might try saying hello.
&gt;[45] d

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[46] open drawer
You open the kitchen drawer, revealing a knife, a fork, and a spoon.

&gt;[47] take knife
Taken.

&gt;[48] open closet
You open the closet, revealing ten MREs and a microwavable dinner.

&gt;[49] take dinner

&gt;[54] s

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

You can also see a cardboard box (empty) and some wrapping paper here.

&gt;[55] get on top bunk
As you clamber up, it looks like there's something wrong with the cabinet door.

&gt;[56] replace screw
You unscrew the old screw and replace it with a new one from your toolbox.

You cross out an item ("fix the cabinet") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[57] get down
You get off the top bunk.

Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[3] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship. It has chewing gum stuck to it.


[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

&gt;[4] u

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

⇒ You can enter "hints" at any time for help in progressing in the game.
Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

Port-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to starboard.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.

You try to enter the airlock, but the automatic door fails to open for you.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[11] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[12] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

[I'll go to hell for this, but here goes...]

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[17] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the blackness of space, speckled with the dying embers of what was once Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.
&gt;[29] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[30] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[31] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[32] vent air
You vent a bit of air from your suit. It propels you just a tiny amount toward the hull, but it's enough. One agonizing minute later, you're attached to the hull again.

[Oh thank god! I thought I was a goner.]

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

&gt;[36] sit in recharger
The nozzles on either side of the chair connect with the suit. After a few moments, the machine emits a pleasant "ping", the nozzles retract, and you stand up.

&gt;[37] p

Machine Room
The machine room is where the physical work of Engineering takes place; for instance, machining new parts. There is a large counter lined with drawers here, as well as numerous saws, drills, and other pieces of equipment. You can leave to starboard.

There's a hand vac sitting on the counter.

&gt;[38] open drawer
You open the machine room drawers, revealing a small key, a roll of electrical tape, a hex-shaped tool, and a fresh fuse.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the midship door, blocking it.

A man's voice comes over comms: "SS Usagi, come in! Is anyone there?"

[Finally, another person! I'm saved!]

⇒ By the way... you can get help about speaking to other characters by typing "help speech".⇒ You might try saying hello.
&gt;[42] move trunk

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[8] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[9] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

You can also see a black trunk (closed) here.

&gt;[10] get trunk
Taken.

&gt;[11] open it
You open the black trunk, revealing a present.

&gt;[12] take present
Taken.

&gt;[13] open it
[I'll go to hell for this, but here goes...]

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[14] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

&gt;[15] p

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

&gt;[16] d

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship. It has chewing gum stuck to it.


&gt;[17] drop trunk
You place the black trunk near the airlock door.

&gt;[18] stand on trunk
(first closing the black trunk)
You get onto the black trunk.

&gt;[19] take broken sensor
You remove the broken sensor from the panel.

&gt;[20] put optical sensor in panel
You insert the fresh sensor into the empty socket.
[There. That should do it.]

You cross out an item ("fix the airlock door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[21] take suit
Taken.

&gt;[22] wear it
You put on the vac suit.

&gt;[23] turn on mag boots
You switch the Magnetic boots on.

&gt;[24] a
(first getting off the black trunk)

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the blackness of space, speckled with the dying embers of what was once Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

&gt;[25] out
It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.
&gt;[26] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[27] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[28] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[29] vent air
You vent a bit of air from your suit. It propels you just a tiny amount toward the hull, but it's enough. One agonizing minute later, you're attached to the hull again.

[Oh thank god! I thought I was a goner.]

Outside the Engineering Airlock (vacuum)

Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to port among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

&gt;[31] in
Welcome back, visitor. I hope your spacewalk was uneventful.

Engineering Airlock
You are in the engineering airlock. Outside, the space to starboard looks so empty and peaceful it's hard to imagine the awful sight astern.

⇒ astern: behind or toward the rear of a ship, spaceship or aircraft.
&gt;[32] p

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

&gt;[33] sit in recharger
The nozzles on either side of the chair connect with the suit. After a few moments, the machine emits a pleasant "ping", the nozzles retract, and you stand up.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[12] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[13] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[17] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[18] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[23] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

&gt;[35] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[36] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[37] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

&gt;[42] sit in recharger
The nozzles on either side of the chair connect with the suit. After a few moments, the machine emits a pleasant "ping", the nozzles retract, and you stand up.

Machine Room
The machine room is where the physical work of Engineering takes place; for instance, machining new parts. There is a large counter lined with drawers here, as well as numerous saws, drills, and other pieces of equipment. You can leave to starboard.

There's a hand vac sitting on the counter.

&gt;[44] open drawer
You open the machine room drawers, revealing a small key, a roll of electrical tape, a hex-shaped tool, and a fresh fuse.

The obvious exits are fore (to hull of the usagi (vacuum)), inside (to aft airlock) and outside.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[112] push jl-758 fore
You grab hold of the EVA transport line to keep yourself on the ship. Better turn your mag boots on.
⇒ If you'd really like to go farther out from the ship, say so with "out".
You push the brand-new JL-758 to Hull of the Usagi (vacuum).

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

The JL-758 is floating here, clipped to the EVA transport line.

The EVA transport line is attached to the hook, and extends aft and starboard from here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[113] push jl-758 starboard
You grab hold of the EVA transport line to keep yourself on the ship. Better turn your mag boots on.
⇒ If you'd really like to go farther out from the ship, say so with "out".
You push the brand-new JL-758 to Outside the Engineering Airlock (vacuum).

Outside the Engineering Airlock (vacuum)
You are floating in the blackness of space outside the engineering airlock. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to port among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

The JL-758 is floating here, clipped to the EVA transport line.

The EVA transport line is attached to the hook, and from there runs to port.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[114] push jl-758 in
You unclip the JL-758 from the EVA transport line.

You push the brand-new JL-758 to Engineering Airlock.

Engineering Airlock
You are in the engineering airlock. Outside, the space to starboard looks so empty and peaceful it's hard to imagine the awful sight astern.

You can see a brand-new JL-758 here.

&gt;[115] push jl-758 in
You push the brand-new JL-758 to Engineering Deck.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

You can also see a brand-new JL-758 here.

&gt;[116] push jl-758 aft
You push the brand-new JL-758 to Engine Room.

You slide the old part out from the engine, and slide the new JL-758 in its place.

Engine Room
This where the combustion process is controlled. The aft wall is dominated by the operating panel section of the fusion engine. Monitoring electronics and controls cover the other two walls. A doorway opens forward to the Engineering Deck.

There is a large screen on the forward wall. It displays nothing right now. There is a large button below the diagram labeled "Test".

You can see a broken JL-758 here.

It seems you completed something ("fix the engine") that wasn't on your to-do list. You note it down.

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

You can see an equipment trunk (closed) here.

A man's voice comes over comms: "Usagi, are you there?"


&gt;[119] d

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[120] a

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[121] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. Nothing happens.
[That's weird. It should at least make a buzz.]

You add an item ("fix the captain's door") to your to-do list.

&gt;[122] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is closed and held fast with a screw.

&gt;[123] open panel
You open the panel, hanging on to the blue screw that held it shut.

The access panel opens to reveal a row of fuses, one of which is blown.

&gt;[124] take blown fuse
Taken.

&gt;[125] put fuse in panel
(the fresh fuse in the access panel)
You put the fresh fuse into the access panel.

&gt;[126] close panel
When you try to close the access panel, the blue screw slips from your grasp, bounces once, rolls, and falls down the ladder well. At the bottom of the ladder, it bounces once more, right through the grill of an air scrubber intake. That screw's long gone.

&gt;[127] close panel
All of your screws are either too big or too small.

&gt;[128] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is open, leaving an empty hole where the screw was.

The panel holds a row of fresh fuses.

&gt;[129] put gum in hole
(first taking the chewing gum)
You unstick the chewing gum from the vac suit.

You push the gum into the hole.
[I hope this works.]

&gt;[130] close panel
You drive a screw into the gum and it holds. The panel is now closed.

You hear a series of beeps, and a voice says "Door now operational."

You cross out an item ("fix the captain's door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[131] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. The Captain's Door slides smoothly open. A pleasant ping indicates it now recognizes you as authorized.

&gt;[132] a
Welcome, repairperson. Please observe appropriate respect for sensitive materials while in the Captain's quarters.

The Captain's Door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. You can exit to fore.

&gt;[133] open drawer
You open the desk drawer, revealing the captain's journal.

&gt;[134] take journal
Taken.

&gt;[135] read it
The Captain's journal is considered off-limits to non-command personnel. This incident has been logged.

The captain's journal is an electronic diary which requires a password to open.
⇒ For example, say "journal, password walrus" to unlock the journal with the password "walrus".
Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[136] journal, password walrus
The journal beeps once to indicate an invalid login.

&gt;[137] journal, password charon
The journal chimes pleasantly and the screen fills with text.

&gt;[138] read journal
The Captain's journal is considered off-limits to non-command personnel. This incident has been logged.

[I never thought it would come to this, eavesdropping on someone's personal thoughts.]

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

[My god...]

&gt;[142] z
Time passes.

A man's voice comes over comms: "Come in, Usagi, Come in, Usagi."


&gt;[143] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax -- you can ask the ship computer about me. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

"Yes sir!" you proclaim, despite his lame joke.

"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[144] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[145] tell arvax about journal
(the captain's journal)
"Oh, Captain no... We must act fast if we're going to stop her from claiming even more lives."

&gt;[146] computer, access code 2
Welcome, Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. Logging you in.

&gt;[147] computer, reboot
Are you sure you wish to reboot?
[148] y

Beginning reboot. Take all appropriate precautions.

Red alert lights flash throughout the ship.

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[12] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[13] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship. It has chewing gum stuck to it.


[What now?]

You try to enter the airlock, but the automatic door fails to open for you.
[It's always just opened in the past.]

You add an item ("fix the airlock door") to your to-do list.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[17] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[18] look under bed

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[23] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.
&gt;[35] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[36] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[37] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

The JL-758 is floating here, clipped to the EVA transport line.

The EVA transport line is attached to the hook, and from there runs to port.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[114] push jl-758 in
You unclip the JL-758 from the EVA transport line.

You push the brand-new JL-758 to Engineering Airlock.

Engineering Airlock
You are in the engineering airlock. Outside, the space to starboard looks so empty and peaceful it's hard to imagine the awful sight astern.

You can see a brand-new JL-758 here.

&gt;[115] push jl-758 in
You push the brand-new JL-758 to Engineering Deck.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

You can also see a brand-new JL-758 here.

&gt;[116] push jl-758 aft
You push the brand-new JL-758 to Engine Room.

You slide the old part out from the engine, and slide the new JL-758 in its place.

Engine Room
This where the combustion process is controlled. The aft wall is dominated by the operating panel section of the fusion engine. Monitoring electronics and controls cover the other two walls. A doorway opens forward to the Engineering Deck.

There is a large screen on the forward wall. It displays nothing right now. There is a large button below the diagram labeled "Test".

You can see a broken JL-758 here.

It seems you completed something ("fix the engine") that wasn't on your to-do list. You note it down.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

You can see an equipment trunk (closed) here.

A man's voice comes over comms: "Come in, Usagi, Come in, Usagi."


&gt;[119] d

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[120] a

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[121] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. Nothing happens.
[That's weird. It should at least make a buzz.]

You add an item ("fix the captain's door") to your to-do list.

&gt;[122] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is closed and held fast with a screw.

&gt;[123] open panel
You open the panel, hanging on to the blue screw that held it shut.

The access panel opens to reveal a row of fuses, one of which is blown.

&gt;[124] take blown fuse
Taken.

&gt;[125] put fuse in panel
(the fresh fuse in the access panel)
You put the fresh fuse into the access panel.

&gt;[126] close panel
When you try to close the access panel, the blue screw slips from your grasp, bounces once, rolls, and falls down the ladder well. At the bottom of the ladder, it bounces once more, right through the grill of an air scrubber intake. That screw's long gone.

&gt;[127] close panel
All of your screws are either too big or too small.

&gt;[128] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is open, leaving an empty hole where the screw was.

The panel holds a row of fresh fuses.

&gt;[129] put gum in hole
(first taking the chewing gum)
You unstick the chewing gum from the vac suit.

You push the gum into the hole.
[I hope this works.]

&gt;[130] close panel
You drive a screw into the gum and it holds. The panel is now closed.

You hear a series of beeps, and a voice says "Door now operational."

You cross out an item ("fix the captain's door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[131] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. The Captain's Door slides smoothly open. A pleasant ping indicates it now recognizes you as authorized.

&gt;[132] a
Welcome, repairperson. Please observe appropriate respect for sensitive materials while in the Captain's quarters.

The Captain's Door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. You can exit to fore.

&gt;[133] open drawer
You open the desk drawer, revealing the captain's journal.

&gt;[134] take journal
Taken.

&gt;[135] read it
The Captain's journal is considered off-limits to non-command personnel. This incident has been logged.

The captain's journal is an electronic diary which requires a password to open.
⇒ For example, say "journal, password walrus" to unlock the journal with the password "walrus".
Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[136] journal, password walrus
The journal beeps once to indicate an invalid login.

&gt;[137] journal, password charon
The journal chimes pleasantly and the screen fills with text.

&gt;[138] read journal
The Captain's journal is considered off-limits to non-command personnel. This incident has been logged.

[I never thought it would come to this, eavesdropping on someone's personal thoughts.]

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

[My god...]

&gt;[142] z
Time passes.

A man's voice comes over comms: "If there's anyone on the Usagi, please respond!"


&gt;[143] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax -- you can ask the ship computer about me. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

"Yes sir!" you proclaim, despite his lame joke.

"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[144] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[145] tell arvax about journal
(the captain's journal)
"Oh, Captain no... We must act fast if we're going to stop her from claiming even more lives."

&gt;[146] computer, access code 2
Welcome, Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. Logging you in.

&gt;[147] computer, reboot
Are you sure you wish to reboot?

Beginning reboot. Take all appropriate precautions.

Red alert lights flash throughout the ship.

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[12] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[13] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship. It has chewing gum stuck to it.


[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

&gt;[14] a
You try to enter the airlock, but the automatic door fails to open for you.
[It's always just opened in the past.]

You add an item ("fix the airlock door") to your to-do list.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[15] u

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

⇒ You can enter "hints" at any time for help in progressing in the game.
&gt;[16] s

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[17] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[18] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

&gt;[19] get trunk
Taken.

&gt;[20] open it
You open the black trunk, revealing a present.

&gt;[21] take present
Taken.

&gt;[22] open it
[I'll go to hell for this, but here goes...]

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[23] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship. It has chewing gum stuck to it.

It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.
&gt;[35] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[36] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[37] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. You can exit to fore.

&gt;[133] open drawer
You open the desk drawer, revealing the captain's journal.

&gt;[134] take journal
Taken.

&gt;[135] read it
The Captain's journal is considered off-limits to non-command personnel. This incident has been logged.

The captain's journal is an electronic diary which requires a password to open.
⇒ For example, say "journal, password walrus" to unlock the journal with the password "walrus".
Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[136] journal, password walrus
The journal beeps once to indicate an invalid login.

&gt;[137] journal, password charon
The journal chimes pleasantly and the screen fills with text.

&gt;[138] read journal
The Captain's journal is considered off-limits to non-command personnel. This incident has been logged.

[I never thought it would come to this, eavesdropping on someone's personal thoughts.]

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

[My god...]

The Captain's Door opens as you approach, and closes silently behind you.

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

&gt;[140] f

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[141] u

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

You can see an equipment trunk (closed) here.

&gt;[142] z
Time passes.

A man's voice comes over comms: "SS Usagi, come in! Is anyone there?"


&gt;[143] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax -- you can ask the ship computer about me. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

"Yes sir!" you proclaim, despite his lame joke.

"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[144] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[145] tell arvax about journal
(the captain's journal)
"Oh, Captain no... We must act fast if we're going to stop her from claiming even more lives."

&gt;[146] computer, access code 2
Welcome, Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. Logging you in.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[12] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[13] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

You try to enter the airlock, but the automatic door fails to open for you.
[It's always just opened in the past.]

You add an item ("fix the airlock door") to your to-do list.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

⇒ You can enter "hints" at any time for help in progressing in the game.
&gt;[16] s

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[17] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[18] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

&gt;[21] take present
Taken.

[I'll go to hell for this, but here goes...]

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[23] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.
&gt;[35] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[36] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[37] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[38] vent air
You vent a bit of air from your suit. It propels you just a tiny amount toward the hull, but it's enough. One agonizing minute later, you're attached to the hull again.

[Oh thank god! I thought I was a goner.]

Machine Room
The machine room is where the physical work of Engineering takes place; for instance, machining new parts. There is a large counter lined with drawers here, as well as numerous saws, drills, and other pieces of equipment. You can leave to starboard.

There's a hand vac sitting on the counter.

&gt;[44] open drawer
You open the machine room drawers, revealing a small key, a roll of electrical tape, a hex-shaped tool, and a fresh fuse.

The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the midship door, blocking it.

A man's voice comes over comms: "If there's anyone on the Usagi, please respond!"

Another routine day of drudgery aboard the Stellar Patrol Ship Feinstein. This morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub brush you shine the floor with a diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.

The alien ambassador from the planet Blow'k-bibben-Gordo ambles toward you from down the corridor. He is munching on something resembling an enormous stalk of celery, and he leaves a trail of green slime on the deck. He stops nearby, and you wince as a pool of slime begins forming beneath him on your newly-polished deck. The ambassador wheezes loudly and hands you a brochure outlining his planet's major exports.

Welcome, repairperson. Please observe appropriate respect for sensitive materials while in the Captain's quarters.

The Captain's Door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. You can exit to fore.

&gt;[133] open drawer
You open the desk drawer, revealing the captain's journal.

The journal chimes pleasantly and the screen fills with text.

&gt;[138] read journal
The Captain's journal is considered off-limits to non-command personnel. This incident has been logged.

[I never thought it would come to this, eavesdropping on someone's personal thoughts.]

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

Time passes.

A man's voice comes over comms: "Come in, Usagi, Come in, Usagi."


&gt;[143] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax -- you can ask the ship computer about me. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

"Yes sir!" you proclaim, despite his lame joke.

"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[144] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[145] tell arvax about journal
(the captain's journal)
"Oh, Captain no... We must act fast if we're going to stop her from claiming even more lives."

"Finally! Where've you been? I'm sad to see you invoked Mulgrew's emergency protocols, but that's water under the bridge. Now we need to try to salvage the situation."

"I'm trying to divert the ship from its collision course with New Da Nang, but there are some problems: the helm is not responding to any commands and the fuel injection specification for the fusion engine is incorrect. 

"To be honest, friend, the readouts I'm seeing about the state of helm control are dire. I'm not sure it can be fixed."

Attention: current trajectory intersects the moon New Da Nang. Please correct course.

Bridge
This is where the captain, navigator, and pilot all sit. Large viewscreens give a full view of the space around the ship. To port you can see the blue-white disk of Deneb. Astern you can faintly see the fading embers of what was Space Station Omicron-5.
 
The pilot's and navigator's chairs sit before the large helm console. The captain's chair, with command console, sits halfway between them and operations further aft.

You hear someone speaking aft of here.

The helm is a sloped table covered with cryptic readouts and touch controls. In the back is an access panel which is closed. A hex-shaped aperture is probably the locking mechanism.

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

⇒ You can always find out the current status by asking Arvax about the ship.

You can see an equipment trunk (closed) here.

Bridge
This is where the captain, navigator, and pilot all sit. Large viewscreens give a full view of the space around the ship. To port you can see the blue-white disk of Deneb. Astern you can faintly see the fading embers of what was Space Station Omicron-5.
 
The pilot's and navigator's chairs sit before the large helm console. The captain's chair, with command console, sits halfway between them and operations further aft.

You hear someone speaking aft of here.

Attention: current trajectory intersects the moon New Da Nang. Please correct course.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[13] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship. It has chewing gum stuck to it.


[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

You try to enter the airlock, but the automatic door fails to open for you.
[It's always just opened in the past.]

You add an item ("fix the airlock door") to your to-do list.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[18] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[19] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[24] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.
&gt;[36] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[37] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[38] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

Engine Room
This where the combustion process is controlled. The aft wall is dominated by the operating panel section of the fusion engine. Monitoring electronics and controls cover the other two walls. A doorway opens forward to the Engineering Deck.

There is a large screen on the forward wall. It displays nothing right now. There is a large button below the diagram labeled "Test".

You can see a broken JL-758 here.

It seems you completed something ("fix the engine") that wasn't on your to-do list. You note it down.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[118] f

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

&gt;[119] f

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

You can see an equipment trunk (closed) here.

A man's voice comes over comms: "SS Usagi, come in! Is anyone there?"


&gt;[120] d

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[121] a

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[122] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. Nothing happens.
[That's weird. It should at least make a buzz.]

You add an item ("fix the captain's door") to your to-do list.

&gt;[123] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is closed and held fast with a screw.

&gt;[124] open panel
You open the panel, hanging on to the blue screw that held it shut.

The access panel opens to reveal a row of fuses, one of which is blown.

&gt;[125] take blown fuse
Taken.

&gt;[126] put fuse in panel
(the fresh fuse in the access panel)
You put the fresh fuse into the access panel.

&gt;[127] close panel
When you try to close the access panel, the blue screw slips from your grasp, bounces once, rolls, and falls down the ladder well. At the bottom of the ladder, it bounces once more, right through the grill of an air scrubber intake. That screw's long gone.

&gt;[128] close panel
All of your screws are either too big or too small.

&gt;[129] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is open, leaving an empty hole where the screw was.

The panel holds a row of fresh fuses.

&gt;[130] put gum in hole
(first taking the chewing gum)
You unstick the chewing gum from the vac suit.

You push the gum into the hole.
[I hope this works.]

&gt;[131] close panel
You drive a screw into the gum and it holds. The panel is now closed.

You hear a series of beeps, and a voice says "Door now operational."

You cross out an item ("fix the captain's door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[132] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. The Captain's Door slides smoothly open. A pleasant ping indicates it now recognizes you as authorized.

&gt;[133] a
Welcome, repairperson. Please observe appropriate respect for sensitive materials while in the Captain's quarters.

The Captain's Door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. You can exit to fore.

&gt;[134] open drawer
You open the desk drawer, revealing the captain's journal.

&gt;[135] take journal
Taken.

&gt;[136] read it
The Captain's journal is considered off-limits to non-command personnel. This incident has been logged.

The captain's journal is an electronic diary which requires a password to open.
⇒ For example, say "journal, password walrus" to unlock the journal with the password "walrus".
Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[137] journal, password walrus
The journal beeps once to indicate an invalid login.

&gt;[138] journal, password charon
The journal chimes pleasantly and the screen fills with text.

&gt;[139] read journal
The Captain's journal is considered off-limits to non-command personnel. This incident has been logged.

[I never thought it would come to this, eavesdropping on someone's personal thoughts.]

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

[My god...]

Time passes.

A man's voice comes over comms: "SS Usagi, come in! Is anyone there?"


&gt;[144] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax -- you can ask the ship computer about me. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

"Yes sir!" you proclaim, despite his lame joke.

"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[145] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[146] tell arvax about journal
(the captain's journal)
"Oh, Captain no... We must act fast if we're going to stop her from claiming even more lives."

&gt;[147] computer, access code 3
Welcome, Captain Jane Mulgrew. Logging you in.

&gt;[148] computer, emergency protocols
Are you sure you wish to invoke the emergency protocols?
[149] y
Beginning emergency protocols. Take all appropriate precautions.

Red alert lights flash throughout the ship.

The emergency depressurization siren sounds throughout the ship.
[Nice of Mulgrew to warn me.]

Emergency protocols complete.
Approaching New Da Nang. Beginning emergency countdown at 60.

&gt;[153] ask arvax about ship
(the ss usagi)
"Finally! Where've you been? I'm sad to see you invoked Mulgrew's emergency protocols, but that's water under the bridge. Now we need to try to salvage the situation."

"I'm trying to divert the ship from its collision course with New Da Nang, but there are some problems: the helm is not responding to any commands and the fuel injection specification for the fusion engine is incorrect. 

"To be honest, friend, the readouts I'm seeing about the state of helm control are dire. I'm not sure it can be fixed."

Bridge
This is where the captain, navigator, and pilot all sit. Large viewscreens give a full view of the space around the ship. To port you can see the blue-white disk of Deneb. Astern you can faintly see the fading embers of what was Space Station Omicron-5.
 
The pilot's and navigator's chairs sit before the large helm console. The captain's chair, with command console, sits halfway between them and operations further aft.

You hear someone speaking aft of here.

&gt;[155] open helm panel with hex-shaped tool
You unlock the helm access panel.

(the helm access panel)
The access panel is a rectangle of the same plastic that makes up the console. There is a hex-shaped keyhole in it.

&gt;[157] open it
Opening the helm access panel reveals a fused mass of wiring and circuit boards. It's ruined beyond repair.

&gt;[164] ask computer about void matter
Void Matter is essentially vacuum condensed into matter, according to the most comprehensible description we could find. It is an extremely unstable substance, and tends to explode catastrophically in the presence of high levels of energy. It can be created by injecting one source of tachyon crystals into another source of tachyon crystals.

&gt;[166] ask computer about tc
Rather than containing or being formed of tachyons, tachyon crystals get their name from their use in detecting tachyons, due to their negative refractive index. The typical method of creating tachyon crystals is injecting Anti-Helium into Red Matter. Tachyon Crystals can be used in the creation of Void Matter.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

⇒ You can always find out the current status by asking Arvax about the ship.

You can see an equipment trunk (closed) here.

The Void Matter is injected into the fusion engine, causing an explosion that rips the ship apart. You are never aware of this, however, as you are instantly vaporized. If you had been aware, you would certainly have been pleased to know that your death saved the people of New Da Nang.



    *** You have died nobly. ***


In that game you scored 7 out of a possible 10, in 168 turns.

Well done! You made the ultimate sacrifice so that others might live. First, we award you one point each for:
- fixing the aft airlock door
- fixing the microwave oven
- fixing the equipment cabinet in the starboard-side crew quarters
- fixing the storage unit in the port-side crew quarters
- fixing the fusion engine
- fixing the captain's door

We also award you one point for saving New Da Nang. Congratulations!


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[14] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[15] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[19] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[25] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[38] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[39] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

Machine Room
The machine room is where the physical work of Engineering takes place; for instance, machining new parts. There is a large counter lined with drawers here, as well as numerous saws, drills, and other pieces of equipment. You can leave to starboard.

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

Time passes.

A man's voice comes over comms: "Come in, Usagi, Come in, Usagi."


&gt;[145] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax -- you can ask the ship computer about me. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

"Yes sir!" you proclaim, despite his lame joke.

"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[146] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[147] tell arvax about journal

Void Matter is essentially vacuum condensed into matter, according to the most comprehensible description we could find. It is an extremely unstable substance, and tends to explode catastrophically in the presence of high levels of energy. It can be created by injecting one source of tachyon crystals into another source of tachyon crystals.

&gt;[164] ask computer about tc
Rather than containing or being formed of tachyons, tachyon crystals get their name from their use in detecting tachyons, due to their negative refractive index. The typical method of creating tachyon crystals is injecting Anti-Helium into Red Matter. Tachyon Crystals can be used in the creation of Void Matter.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

"9"

&gt;[171] s

Engineering Airlock
You are in the engineering airlock. Outside, the space to starboard looks so empty and peaceful it's hard to imagine the awful sight astern.

"8"

&gt;[172] out
You propel yourself away from the ship, away from the explosion that follows moments later. You switch on your beacon. Hours later, after you'd given up hope, a ship of the Space Marines finds you and brings you home. You are sorry you couldn't save the SS Usagi, but for your part in saving the people of New Da Nang, you receive a medal for meritorious service and are promoted to Lance Corporal.



    *** You saved New Da Nang, but lost the ship. ***


In that game you scored 8 out of a possible 10, in 157 turns.

Hooray for saving New Da Nang! The Space Marine leadership is less happy about losing the SS Usagi. But here's your score breakdown. You get one point each for:
- fixing the aft airlock door
- fixing the microwave oven
- fixing the equipment cabinet in the starboard-side crew quarters
- fixing the storage unit in the port-side crew quarters
- fixing the fusion engine
- fixing the captain's door

You also get a point for saving yourself, and a point for saving New Da Nang! Congratulations!


Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, or UNDO the last command?

Looking outside --

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[12] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[23] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[37] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

You push the brand-new JL-758 to Hull of the Usagi (vacuum).

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

The JL-758 is floating here, clipped to the EVA transport line.

The EVA transport line is attached to the hook, and extends aft and starboard from here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[113] push jl-758 starboard
You grab hold of the EVA transport line to keep yourself on the ship. Better turn your mag boots on.
⇒ If you'd really like to go farther out from the ship, say so with "out".
You push the brand-new JL-758 to Outside the Engineering Airlock (vacuum).

Outside the Engineering Airlock (vacuum)
You are floating in the blackness of space outside the engineering airlock. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to port among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

The JL-758 is floating here, clipped to the EVA transport line.

The EVA transport line is attached to the hook, and from there runs to port.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[114] push jl-758 in
You unclip the JL-758 from the EVA transport line.

You push the brand-new JL-758 to Engineering Airlock.

Engineering Airlock
You are in the engineering airlock. Outside, the space to starboard looks so empty and peaceful it's hard to imagine the awful sight astern.

You can see a brand-new JL-758 here.

&gt;[115] push jl-758 in
You push the brand-new JL-758 to Engineering Deck.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

You can also see a brand-new JL-758 here.

&gt;[116] push jl-758 aft
You push the brand-new JL-758 to Engine Room.

You slide the old part out from the engine, and slide the new JL-758 in its place.

Engine Room
This where the combustion process is controlled. The aft wall is dominated by the operating panel section of the fusion engine. Monitoring electronics and controls cover the other two walls. A doorway opens forward to the Engineering Deck.

There is a large screen on the forward wall. It displays nothing right now. There is a large button below the diagram labeled "Test".

You can see a broken JL-758 here.

It seems you completed something ("fix the engine") that wasn't on your to-do list. You note it down.

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

You can see an equipment trunk (closed) here.

A man's voice comes over comms: "Come in, Usagi, Come in, Usagi."


&gt;[119] d

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[120] a

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[121] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. Nothing happens.
[That's weird. It should at least make a buzz.]

You add an item ("fix the captain's door") to your to-do list.

&gt;[122] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is closed and held fast with a screw.

&gt;[123] open panel
You open the panel, hanging on to the blue screw that held it shut.

The access panel opens to reveal a row of fuses, one of which is blown.

&gt;[124] take blown fuse
Taken.

&gt;[125] put fuse in panel
(the fresh fuse in the access panel)
You put the fresh fuse into the access panel.

&gt;[126] close panel
When you try to close the access panel, the blue screw slips from your grasp, bounces once, rolls, and falls down the ladder well. At the bottom of the ladder, it bounces once more, right through the grill of an air scrubber intake. That screw's long gone.

&gt;[127] close panel
All of your screws are either too big or too small.

&gt;[128] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is open, leaving an empty hole where the screw was.

The panel holds a row of fresh fuses.

&gt;[129] put gum in hole
(first taking the chewing gum)
You unstick the chewing gum from the vac suit.

You push the gum into the hole.
[I hope this works.]

&gt;[130] close panel
You drive a screw into the gum and it holds. The panel is now closed.

You hear a series of beeps, and a voice says "Door now operational."

You cross out an item ("fix the captain's door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[131] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. The Captain's Door slides smoothly open. A pleasant ping indicates it now recognizes you as authorized.

&gt;[132] a
Welcome, repairperson. Please observe appropriate respect for sensitive materials while in the Captain's quarters.

The Captain's Door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. You can exit to fore.

&gt;[133] open drawer
You open the desk drawer, revealing the captain's journal.

&gt;[134] take journal
Taken.

&gt;[135] read it
The Captain's journal is considered off-limits to non-command personnel. This incident has been logged.

The captain's journal is an electronic diary which requires a password to open.
⇒ For example, say "journal, password walrus" to unlock the journal with the password "walrus".
Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[136] journal, password walrus
The journal beeps once to indicate an invalid login.

&gt;[137] journal, password charon
The journal chimes pleasantly and the screen fills with text.

&gt;[138] read journal
The Captain's journal is considered off-limits to non-command personnel. This incident has been logged.

[I never thought it would come to this, eavesdropping on someone's personal thoughts.]

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

[My god...]

Time passes.

A man's voice comes over comms: "Usagi, are you there?"


&gt;[143] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax -- you can ask the ship computer about me. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

"Yes sir!" you proclaim, despite his lame joke.

"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[144] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[145] tell arvax about journal
(the captain's journal)
"Oh, Captain no... We must act fast if we're going to stop her from claiming even more lives."

&gt;[146] computer, access code 2
Access denied.

&gt;[147] computer, reboot
Authorization required.

Captain Mulgrew: "Calling the SS Usagi..."

&gt;[148] y
I'm not sure what question you're answering.

&gt;[149] z
Time passes.

&gt;[150] z
Time passes.

Captain Mulgrew: "Any questions?"

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

The helm is a sloped table covered with cryptic readouts and touch controls. In the back is an access panel which is closed. A hex-shaped aperture is probably the locking mechanism.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Bridge
This is where the captain, navigator, and pilot all sit. Large viewscreens give a full view of the space around the ship. To port you can see the blue-white disk of Deneb. Astern you can faintly see the fading embers of what was Space Station Omicron-5.
 
The pilot's and navigator's chairs sit before the large helm console. The captain's chair, with command console, sits halfway between them and operations further aft.

You hear someone speaking aft of here.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship.

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship. It has chewing gum stuck to it.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship. It has chewing gum stuck to it.

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

&gt;[4] f
You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[5] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[6] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

You try to enter the airlock, but the automatic door fails to open for you.
[It's always just opened in the past.]

You add an item ("fix the airlock door") to your to-do list.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[8] u

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

⇒ You can enter "hints" at any time for help in progressing in the game.
&gt;[9] s

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[10] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[11] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters

There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

You can also see a black trunk (closed) here.

&gt;[12] get trunk
Taken.

&gt;[13] open it
You open the black trunk, revealing a present.

&gt;[14] take present
Taken.

&gt;[15] open it
[I'll go to hell for this, but here goes...]

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[16] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

You get onto the black trunk.

&gt;[21] take broken sensor
You remove the broken sensor from the panel.

&gt;[22] put optical sensor in panel
You insert the fresh sensor into the empty socket.
[There. That should do it.]

You cross out an item ("fix the airlock door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[23] take suit

(first getting off the black trunk)

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the blackness of space, speckled with the dying embers of what was once Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

&gt;[27] out
It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.
&gt;[28] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[29] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[30] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[31] vent air
You vent a bit of air from your suit. It propels you just a tiny amount toward the hull, but it's enough. One agonizing minute later, you're attached to the hull again.

[Oh thank god! I thought I was a goner.]

&gt;[33] in
Welcome back, visitor. I hope your spacewalk was uneventful.

Engineering Airlock
You are in the engineering airlock. Outside, the space to starboard looks so empty and peaceful it's hard to imagine the awful sight astern.

⇒ astern: behind or toward the rear of a ship, spaceship or aircraft.
&gt;[34] p

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

&gt;[35] sit in recharger
The nozzles on either side of the chair connect with the suit. After a few moments, the machine emits a pleasant "ping", the nozzles retract, and you stand up.

&gt;[36] p

Machine Room
The machine room is where the physical work of Engineering takes place; for instance, machining new parts. There is a large counter lined with drawers here, as well as numerous saws, drills, and other pieces of equipment. You can leave to starboard.

There's a hand vac sitting on the counter.

&gt;[37] open drawer
You open the machine room drawers, revealing a small key, a roll of electrical tape, a hex-shaped tool, and a fresh fuse.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[38] take all
portable hand-held vacuum cleaner: Taken.
small key: Taken.
roll of electrical tape: Taken.

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the midship door, blocking it.

A man's voice comes over comms: "Usagi, are you there?"

[Finally, another person! I'm saved!]

⇒ By the way... you can get help about speaking to other characters by typing "help speech".⇒ You might try saying hello.
&gt;[41] move trunk
You push the trunk clear of the door.

&gt;[42] set gravity control to 1
You dial the gravity to 1.

A man's voice comes over comms: "SS Usagi, come in! Is anyone there?"


&gt;[43] press button
The door slides open.

&gt;[44] d

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[45] open drawer
You open the kitchen drawer, revealing a knife, a fork, and a spoon.

&gt;[46] take knife
Taken.

&gt;[47] open closet
You open the closet, revealing ten MREs and a microwavable dinner.

&gt;[48] take dinner
Taken.

&gt;[49] unplug microwave
(the microwave oven)
You unplug the microwave oven.

&gt;[50] vacuum socket
You vacuum the dust out of the socket.

&gt;[51] plug in microwave
(the microwave oven)
You plug in the microwave oven. It beeps three times and displays "Press Start".

You cross out an item ("fix the microwave") on your to-do list.

&gt;[53] s

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

You can also see a cardboard box (empty) and some wrapping paper here.

&gt;[54] get on top bunk
As you clamber up, it looks like there's something wrong with the cabinet door.

&gt;[55] replace screw
You unscrew the old screw and replace it with a new one from your toolbox.

You cross out an item ("fix the cabinet") on your to-do list.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

You can also see a cardboard box (empty) and some wrapping paper here.

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.
