Crash
An Interactive Disaster by Phil Riley
Release 5 / Serial number 220727 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[13] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[14] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

You try to enter the airlock, but the automatic door fails to open for you.
[It's always just opened in the past.]

You add an item ("fix the airlock door") to your to-do list.

&gt;[16] u

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

⇒ You can enter "hints" at any time for help in progressing in the game.

&gt;[17] s

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[18] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[19] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

&gt;[20] get trunk
Taken.

&gt;[21] open it
You open the black trunk, revealing a present.

&gt;[22] take present
Taken.

&gt;[23] open it
[I'll go to hell for this, but here goes...]

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[24] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

(first getting off the black trunk)

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the blackness of space, speckled with the dying embers of what was once Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

&gt;[35] out
It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.

&gt;[36] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[37] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[38] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[39] vent air
You vent a bit of air from your suit. It propels you just a tiny amount toward the hull, but it's enough. One agonizing minute later, you're attached to the hull again.

[Oh thank god! I thought I was a goner.]

You are in the engineering airlock. Outside, the space to starboard looks so empty and peaceful it's hard to imagine the awful sight astern.

⇒ astern: behind or toward the rear of a ship, spaceship or aircraft.

&gt;[42] p

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

You hear someone speaking forward of here.

&gt;[43] sit in recharger
The nozzles on either side of the chair connect with the suit. After a few moments, the machine emits a pleasant "ping", the nozzles retract, and you stand up.

&gt;[44] p

Machine Room
The machine room is where the physical work of Engineering takes place; for instance, machining new parts. There is a large counter lined with drawers here, as well as numerous saws, drills, and other pieces of equipment. You can leave to starboard.

There's a hand vac sitting on the counter.

&gt;[45] open drawer
You open the machine room drawers, revealing a small key, a roll of electrical tape, a hex-shaped tool, and a fresh fuse.

&gt;[46] take all

This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls, communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the midship door, blocking it.

A man's voice comes over comms: "Usagi, are you there?"

[Finally, another person! I'm saved!]

⇒ By the way... you can get help about speaking to other characters by typing "help speech".

⇒ You might try saying hello.

&gt;[49] move trunk
You push the trunk clear of the door.

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

[No, no, no. This is hitting too close to home. Better quit and focus on saving the ship.]

Port-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is open and contains an engineering uniform. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to starboard.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

You can also see a black trunk (closed) here.

You open the desk drawer, revealing the captain's journal.

&gt;[135] take journal
Taken.

&gt;[136] read it
The captain's journal is an electronic diary which requires a password to open.
⇒ For example, say "journal, password walrus" to unlock the journal with the password "walrus".

&gt;[137] journal, password walrus
The journal beeps once to indicate an invalid login.

&gt;[138] journal, password charon
The journal chimes pleasantly and the screen fills with text.

&gt;[139] read journal
[I never thought it would come to this, eavesdropping on someone's personal thoughts.]

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

A man's voice comes over comms: "If there's anyone on the Usagi, please respond!"


&gt;[144] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

&gt;[145] tell caller about me
You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

&gt;[146] yes
"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[147] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[148] tell arvax about journal

You can see an equipment trunk (closed) here.

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax: "You there, Usagi? We don't have much time."

&gt;[168] ask arvax about ship
(the SS Usagi)
"The only thing we time to focus on is the ship!

"Looks like the ship is ready to fly! Quick! Get to the bridge and use the command console! Say 'computer, execute'"
[Not much time!]

"Impact in 9."

&gt;[169] f

Bridge
This is where the captain, navigator, and pilot all sit. Large viewscreens give a full view of the space around the ship. To port you can see the huge blue-white disk of Deneb. Ahead, the moon New Da Nang looms steadily larger and larger before you.

 The pilot's and navigator's chairs sit before their respective consoles. The captain's chair, with command console, sits halfway between them and operations further aft.

"Impact in 8."

The moon of New Da Nang looms ever larger on the forward viewscreen.

&gt;[170] touch command console

Welcome, Captain. What are your orders?
"Impact in 7."

The moon of New Da Nang looms ever larger on the forward viewscreen.

&gt;[171] computer, execute

Yes, Captain. Executing evasive maneuvers.

The ship pulls out of its dive toward New Da Nang, delivering a g-force that forces the breath out of you despite the intertial dampers. Soon you are turned around and headed for open space.

Diverting communications to the bridge.

Arvax comes over comms: "Diverting SS Usagi to Deneb III. Rendezvous with retrieval crew in approximately twenty-eight minutes.

"Sergeant Screwdriver, this couldn't have happened without you. You deserve to be a hero on New Da Nang, but unfortunately we need to keep this incident secret, as will no doubt be emphasized at your debriefing.

"You are to be especially commended for your judgment in determining the correct course of action when presented with a difficult choice. We have determined that Captain Mulgrew has been working with the separatists and was involved in the Omicron-5 bombing. She has been apprehended and will face the most severe justice permitted by the Space Authority.

"Now, soldier, time to relax. The crew will be there soon to pick you up."

You relax in the captain's chair and reflect on your accomplishment. When you get to the Deneb III space platform, you are whisked off for a series of debriefings and meetings.

At the end of the day, you can barely sleep, as the newest member of the 95th Mechanical Division Special Maintenance Force. Adventure at last!



    *** You have saved New Da Nang, the SS Usagi, and yourself! ***


In that game you scored 10 out of a possible 10, in 159 turns.

For your heroism in the face of almost certain death, we award you one point each for:
- fixing the aft airlock door
- fixing the microwave oven
- fixing the equipment cabinet in the starboard-side crew quarters

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[2] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[3] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

Crash

&gt;[4] wear vac suit
(first taking the vac suit)
You put on the vac suit.

&gt;[5] u

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

⇒ You can enter "hints" at any time for help in progressing in the game.

&gt;[6] p

Port-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to starboard.

&gt;[7] open cabinet
You open the port-side equipment cabinet, revealing an engineering uniform and an Universal Game Emulator.

&gt;[8] x engineering uniform
Colored the traditional mustard yellow of Engineering, it's really a remarkably ugly uniform.

In the engineering uniform is a piece of note paper.

&gt;[9] read paper
Scribbled on the paper is the number 9467.

&gt;[10] type 9467 on keypad
As you press a key, the storage unit starts buzzing continuously. The display lights up with random characters, and you smell the distinct odor of burning wires. The bottom storage drawer pops out a centimeter or two.

You add an item ("fix the storage unit") to your to-do list.

&gt;[11] read list
You have the following items on your to-do list: fix the microwave, fix the cabinet, and fix the storage unit. 

&gt;[12] x storage unit
The storage unit consists of top and bottom drawers, with an attached keypad and display. There is a keyhole under the keypad. The top drawer is closed; the bottom drawer juts out by a couple of centimeters.

&gt;[13] open bottom drawer
The drawer is partially open, but you can't find a purchase on it firm enough to open it.

&gt;[14] x universal game emulator
This device, the Universal Game Emulator, or "UGE", can play any game ever produced for any system.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[17] read note
Written on the note is "Mail package to Mitchell ASAP".

&gt;[18] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[19] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

You can also see a black trunk (closed) here.

&gt;[20] open trunk
You open the black trunk, revealing a present.

&gt;[21] open present
[I'll go to hell for this, but here goes...]

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[22] x bear
Bertie the Bear™ is a massively popular toy. It accepts voice commands, and its eyes, actually advanced optical sensors, can differentiate between individuals. This bear's blindly staring eyes are unnerving.

&gt;[23] x eyes
They're well disguised, but the eyes are clearly top-of-the-line optical sensors that you might see in more serious uses, such as in facial recognition devices.

&gt;[24] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

&gt;[25] take trunk
Taken.

&gt;[28] drop trunk
Dropped.

&gt;[29] a
You try to enter the airlock, but the automatic door fails to open for you.
[It's always just opened in the past.]

You add an item ("fix the airlock door") to your to-do list.

&gt;[30] x door
The airlock door is an imposing solid barrier between vacuum and safety. It is colored yellow with red warning symbols on it. Above the door is a panel of electronic components.

&gt;[31] x panel
The component panel is too high.

&gt;[32] stand on trunk
(first closing the black trunk)
You get onto the black trunk.

&gt;[33] x panel
The prominent features of the panel are two optical sensors. One of them has become partially detached and looks broken.

&gt;[34] take broken sensor
You remove the broken sensor from the panel.

&gt;[35] put new sensor in panel
You insert the fresh sensor into the empty socket.
[There. That should do it.]

You cross out an item ("fix the airlock door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[36] a

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the blackness of space, speckled with the dying embers of what was once Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

&gt;[37] a
It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.

&gt;[38] turn on boots
You switch the Magnetic boots on.

&gt;[39] a

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[40] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[41] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[42] x suit
A puffy yellow suit with an attached helmet and magnetic boots. The gloves are misshapen things, optimized for carrying weaponry, not precision work. There is a nozzle on the front through which air can be recharged or vented. Lights indicate the boots are currently on. A gauge indicates the suit has 12 units of air left.
[I always wanted one of these.]

⇒ You can vent air by using "vent suit"

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[43] vent suit
You vent a bit of air from your suit. It propels you just a tiny amount toward the hull, but it's enough. One agonizing minute later, you're attached to the hull again.

[Oh thank god! I thought I was a goner.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

&gt;[47] sit in chair
The nozzles on either side of the chair connect with the suit. After a few moments, the machine emits a pleasant "ping", the nozzles retract, and you stand up.

You hear someone speaking forward of here.

&gt;[48] f

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls, communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the midship door, blocking it.

&gt;[49] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

&gt;[50] tell caller about me
You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

&gt;[51] yes
"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[52] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[53] ask arvax about mulgrew
"Let me guess. She told you I'm a separatist stooge, right? I guess it's time to blow my cover. I've been cultivating that image for several years now to infiltrate Deneb IV. Here. Enter my access code: 'computer, access code 2' and look up 'Operation Dalmatian'."

&gt;[54] ask mulgrew about dalmatian
"Never heard of it. No doubt another of Arvax's lies."

&gt;[55] computer, access code 2

Welcome, Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. Logging you in.

&gt;[56] ask computer about dalmatian

Operation Dalmatian is a top secret operation to infiltrate the Deneb IV separatist movement. The primary operative is Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax, who has been playing double agent to ingratiate himself with the terrorist leadership. Among other successes, he has confirmed that as many as three Space Marine captains are compromised by the separatists, although he has not been able to positively identify these captains.

Captain Mulgrew: "Calling the SS Usagi..."

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls, communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the midship door, blocking it.

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax: "Hey, friend, we need to reboot the computer soon before it's too late."

&gt;[67] push trunk
You push the trunk clear of the door.

&gt;[68] press blue button
The door slides open.

Captain Mulgrew: "Calling the SS Usagi..."

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

&gt;[70] x microwave
(the microwave oven)
The microwave is closed. It's plugged into a socket inset in the countertop. The front display is black. A large red button below the display says "Start".

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[71] unplug microwave

You unplug the microwave oven.

&gt;[72] x socket
It's an ordinary grounded wall socket. Upon close inspection, you notice that it's clogged up with dust.

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[73] vacuum socket
You vacuum the dust out of the socket.

&gt;[74] plug in microwave
(the microwave oven)
You plug in the microwave oven. It beeps three times and displays "Press Start".

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

&gt;[78] p

Port-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is open and contains an engineering uniform and an Universal Game Emulator. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to starboard.

&gt;[79] x unit
The storage unit consists of top and bottom drawers, with an attached keypad and display. There is a keyhole under the keypad. The top drawer is closed; the bottom drawer juts out by a couple of centimeters.

&gt;[80] open bottom drawer
The drawer is partially open, but you can't find a purchase on it firm enough to open it.

&gt;[81] open bottom drawer with knife
You wedge the knife into the seam and lever the drawer open, revealing the red access card.

&gt;[82] take card
Taken.

&gt;[83] close bottom drawer
You close the bottom drawer.

&gt;[84] x unit
The storage unit consists of top and bottom drawers, with an attached keypad and display. There is a keyhole under the keypad. Both drawers are closed.

&gt;[85] x keypad
A standard 0-9 keypad with a "*" and "#". Below the keys is a small keyhole.

&gt;[86] open keypad with key
You open the front panel of the keypad, revealing a bundle of wiring. You can see the problem immediately -- two wires with worn insulation are in contact, causing a short-circuit.

&gt;[87] tape wires
You wrap the wires in electrical tape and close the keypad.

You cross out an item ("fix the storage unit") on your to-do list.

&gt;[89] a
The door stays shut as you try to go through it.
[Almost bumped my head.]

&gt;[90] open door with card
You slide the red access card through the slot. Nothing happens.
[That's weird. It should at least make a buzz.]

You add an item ("fix the captain's door") to your to-do list.

&gt;[91] x door
The Captain's Door is a conventional, self-opening starship door. It is painted in the traditional red of a starship captain. It features a slot through which you may slide the appropriate access card. Beside the door is an access panel, which is closed.

&gt;[92] open panel
You open the panel, hanging on to the blue screw that held it shut.

The access panel opens to reveal a row of fuses, one of which is blown.

&gt;[93] take blown fuse
Taken.

&gt;[94] put fresh fuse in panel
You put the fresh fuse into the access panel.

&gt;[95] close panel
When you try to close the access panel, the blue screw slips from your grasp, bounces once, rolls, and falls down the ladder well. At the bottom of the ladder, it bounces once more, right through the grill of an air scrubber intake. That screw's long gone.

&gt;[96] close panel
All of your screws are either too big or too small.

&gt;[97] put gum in hole
(first taking the chewing gum)
You can't reach the gum with the vac suit on top of your uniform.

&gt;[98] remove suit
You take off the vac suit.

The boots are now switched off.

&gt;[99] put gum in hole
(first taking the chewing gum)
You push the gum into the hole.
[I hope this works.]

&gt;[100] wear suit
You put on the vac suit.

&gt;[101] turn on boots
You switch the Magnetic boots on.

&gt;[102] close panel
You drive a screw into the gum and it holds. The panel is now closed.

You hear a series of beeps, and a voice says "Door now operational."

You cross out an item ("fix the captain's door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[103] open door with card
You slide the red access card through the slot. The Captain's Door slides smoothly open. A pleasant ping indicates it now recognizes you as authorized.

&gt;[104] a
The Captain's Door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. You can exit to fore.

&gt;[105] x desk
(the captain's desk)
The Captain's desk is a simple institutional metal desk with a single drawer,  which is closed. On the desk are two framed photos, one of a dog, who by his tag must be named "Pluto", and another of an astronaut planting a flag on Earth's moon.

&gt;[106] x dog
Pluto is a beagle with a wise, knowing look on his face.
[Cute dog.]

&gt;[107] x moon
The iconic photo of Neil Armstrong standing next to the American flag.

&gt;[108] open drawer
You open the desk drawer, revealing the captain's journal.

&gt;[109] take journal
Taken.

&gt;[110] read it
The captain's journal is an electronic diary which requires a password to open.
⇒ For example, say "journal, password walrus" to unlock the journal with the password "walrus".

&gt;[111] journal, password walrus
The journal beeps once to indicate an invalid login.

&gt;[112] ask computer about pluto

Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto is now considered a dwarf planet. Along with many of the trans-Neptunian dwarf planets, Pluto is part of the solar system's defensive "early warning" system, with a listening post on its largest moon, Charon.

&gt;[113] journal, password charon
The journal chimes pleasantly and the screen fills with text.

&gt;[114] read diary
[I never thought it would come to this, eavesdropping on someone's personal thoughts.]

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

[My god...]

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

You can also see a cardboard box (empty) and some wrapping paper here.

&gt;[117] get on bed
You get onto the top bunk.

&gt;[118] x cabinet
You can see the problem from up here: the top hinge of the cabinet door has a crooked screw, probably from the door being slammed too many times. You'll have to replace it.

&gt;[119] replace screw
You unscrew the old screw and replace it with a new one.

You cross out an item ("fix the cabinet") on your to-do list.

This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

There is an air scrubber intake in the wall here.

You can also see a black trunk (closed) here.

&gt;[128] x engine part
This is a wide, low, trapezoidal hunk of metal bearing the marking JL-758 on one side. Numerous electrical contacts dot the upper surface. Someone has threaded a thick cord with clips on both ends through some openings on the top and side.

&gt;[129] x cord
It looks like this is meant to attach the JL-758 to something.

&gt;[130] x locker

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

There is an air scrubber intake in the wall here.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[12] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[13] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[17] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[23] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.

&gt;[35] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[36] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[37] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

You hear someone speaking forward of here.

Machine Room
The machine room is where the physical work of Engineering takes place; for instance, machining new parts. There is a large counter lined with drawers here, as well as numerous saws, drills, and other pieces of equipment. You can leave to starboard.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

You can also see a black trunk (closed) here.

&gt;[108] turn off boots
You switch the Magnetic boots off.

&gt;[109] push jl-758 aft
(the JL-758 aft)
You push the JL-758 to Aft Airlock.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the blackness of space, speckled with the dying embers of what was once Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

You can see a JL-758 here.

&gt;[110] push jl-758 aft
(the JL-758 aft)
You clip the JL-758 to the tether.

You grab hold of the tether to keep yourself on the ship. Better turn your mag boots on.
⇒ If you'd really like to go farther out from the ship, say so with "out".

You push the JL-758 to Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum).

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are floating in the blackness of space outside of the aft airlock. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

The JL-758 is floating here, clipped to the tether.

The tether is attached to the hook, and from there runs forward.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[111] push jl-758 aft
(the JL-758 aft)
The obvious exits are fore (to hull of the usagi (vacuum)), inside (to aft airlock) and outside.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[112] push jl-758 fore
(the JL-758 fore)
You grab hold of the tether to keep yourself on the ship. Better turn your mag boots on.
⇒ If you'd really like to go farther out from the ship, say so with "out".

You push the JL-758 to Hull of the Usagi (vacuum).

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

The JL-758 is floating here, clipped to the tether.

The tether is attached to the hook, and extends aft and starboard from here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[113] push jl-758 starboard
(the JL-758 starboard)
You grab hold of the tether to keep yourself on the ship. Better turn your mag boots on.
⇒ If you'd really like to go farther out from the ship, say so with "out".

You push the JL-758 to Outside the Engineering Airlock (vacuum).

Outside the Engineering Airlock (vacuum)
You are floating in the blackness of space outside the engineering airlock. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to port among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

The JL-758 is floating here, clipped to the tether.

The tether is attached to the hook, and from there runs to port.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[114] push jl-758 in
(the JL-758 inside)
You unclip the JL-758 from the tether.

You push the JL-758 to Engineering Airlock.

Engineering Airlock
You are in the engineering airlock. Outside, the space to starboard looks so empty and peaceful it's hard to imagine the awful sight astern.

You can see a JL-758 here.

&gt;[115] push jl-758 in
(the JL-758 inside)
You push the JL-758 to Engineering Deck.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

You can also see a JL-758 here.

&gt;[116] push jl-758 aft
(the JL-758 aft)
You push the JL-758 to Engine Room.

You slide the old part out from the engine, and slide the new JL-758 in its place.

Engine Room
This where the combustion process is controlled. The aft wall is dominated by the operating panel of the fusion engine. Monitoring electronics and controls cover the other two walls. A doorway opens forward to the Engineering Deck.

There is a large screen on the forward wall. It displays nothing right now. There is a large button below the diagram labeled "Test".

You can see a broken JL-758 here.

It seems you completed something ("fix the engine") that wasn't on your to-do list. You note it down.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[118] f

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls, communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

You can see an equipment trunk (closed) here.

A man's voice comes over comms: "SS Usagi, come in! Is anyone there?"


&gt;[119] d

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

&gt;[120] a

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

&gt;[121] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. Nothing happens.
[That's weird. It should at least make a buzz.]

You add an item ("fix the captain's door") to your to-do list.

&gt;[122] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is closed and held fast with a screw.

&gt;[123] open panel
You open the panel, hanging on to the blue screw that held it shut.

The access panel opens to reveal a row of fuses, one of which is blown.

&gt;[124] take blown fuse
Taken.

&gt;[125] put fuse in panel
(the fresh fuse in the access panel)
You put the fresh fuse into the access panel.

&gt;[126] close panel
When you try to close the access panel, the blue screw slips from your grasp, bounces once, rolls, and falls down the ladder well. At the bottom of the ladder, it bounces once more, right through the grill of an air scrubber intake. That screw's long gone.

&gt;[127] close panel
All of your screws are either too big or too small.

&gt;[128] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is open, leaving an empty hole where the screw was.

The panel holds a row of fresh fuses.

&gt;[129] put gum in hole
You push the gum into the hole.
[I hope this works.]

&gt;[130] close panel
You drive a screw into the gum and it holds. The panel is now closed.

You hear a series of beeps, and a voice says "Door now operational."

You cross out an item ("fix the captain's door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[131] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. The Captain's Door slides smoothly open. A pleasant ping indicates it now recognizes you as authorized.

&gt;[132] a
The Captain's Door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. You can exit to fore.

&gt;[133] open drawer
You open the desk drawer, revealing the captain's journal.

&gt;[134] take journal
Taken.

&gt;[135] read it
The captain's journal is an electronic diary which requires a password to open.
⇒ For example, say "journal, password walrus" to unlock the journal with the password "walrus".

&gt;[136] journal, password walrus
The journal beeps once to indicate an invalid login.

&gt;[137] journal, password charon
The journal chimes pleasantly and the screen fills with text.

&gt;[138] read journal
[I never thought it would come to this, eavesdropping on someone's personal thoughts.]

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

[My god...]

&gt;[142] z
Time passes.

A man's voice comes over comms: "If there's anyone on the Usagi, please respond!"


&gt;[143] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

&gt;[144] tell caller about me
You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

&gt;[145] yes
"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[146] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[147] tell arvax about journal
(the captain's journal)
"Oh, Captain no... We must act fast if we're going to stop what she's put in motion."

&gt;[148] computer, access code 2

Welcome, Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. Logging you in.

&gt;[149] computer, reboot

Beginning reboot. Take all appropriate precautions.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[13] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[14] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[24] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[38] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is open, leaving an empty hole where the screw was.

The panel holds a row of fresh fuses.

&gt;[130] put gum in hole
You push the gum into the hole.
[I hope this works.]

&gt;[131] close panel
You drive a screw into the gum and it holds. The panel is now closed.

You hear a series of beeps, and a voice says "Door now operational."

You cross out an item ("fix the captain's door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[132] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. The Captain's Door slides smoothly open. A pleasant ping indicates it now recognizes you as authorized.

&gt;[133] a
The Captain's Door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. You can exit to fore.

&gt;[134] open drawer
You open the desk drawer, revealing the captain's journal.

&gt;[135] take journal
Taken.

&gt;[136] read it
The captain's journal is an electronic diary which requires a password to open.
⇒ For example, say "journal, password walrus" to unlock the journal with the password "walrus".

&gt;[137] journal, password walrus
The journal beeps once to indicate an invalid login.

&gt;[138] journal, password charon
The journal chimes pleasantly and the screen fills with text.

&gt;[139] read journal
[I never thought it would come to this, eavesdropping on someone's personal thoughts.]

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

[My god...]

&gt;[140] f
The Captain's Door opens as you approach, and closes silently behind you.

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

&gt;[141] f

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[142] u

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls, communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

You can see an equipment trunk (closed) here.

&gt;[143] z
Time passes.

A man's voice comes over comms: "If there's anyone on the Usagi, please respond!"


&gt;[144] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

&gt;[145] tell caller about me
You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

&gt;[146] yes
"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[147] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[148] tell arvax about journal
(the captain's journal)
"Oh, Captain no... We must act fast if we're going to stop what she's put in motion."

&gt;[149] computer, access code 2

Welcome, Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. Logging you in.

&gt;[150] computer, reboot

Beginning reboot. Take all appropriate precautions.

Red alert lights flash throughout the ship.

(the SS Usagi)
"You're back! Great job rebooting the computer -- I'm getting telemetry now.

"The only thing we time to focus on is the ship!

"I'm trying to divert the ship from its collision course with New Da Nang, but there's a problem: the fuel injection specification for the fusion engine is incorrect.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

Engine Room
This where the combustion process is controlled. The aft wall is dominated by the operating panel of the fusion engine. Monitoring electronics and controls cover the other two walls. A doorway opens forward to the Engineering Deck.

There is a large diagram of the fuel injection process on the forward wall. There is a large button below the diagram labeled "Test".

You can see a broken JL-758 here.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[11] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[12] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[36] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

&gt;[125] close panel
When you try to close the access panel, the blue screw slips from your grasp, bounces once, rolls, and falls down the ladder well. At the bottom of the ladder, it bounces once more, right through the grill of an air scrubber intake. That screw's long gone.

&gt;[126] close panel
All of your screws are either too big or too small.

&gt;[127] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is open, leaving an empty hole where the screw was.

The panel holds a row of fresh fuses.

&gt;[128] put gum in hole
You push the gum into the hole.
[I hope this works.]

&gt;[129] close panel
You drive a screw into the gum and it holds. The panel is now closed.

You hear a series of beeps, and a voice says "Door now operational."

You cross out an item ("fix the captain's door") on your to-do list.

[Your score has just gone up by one point.]

&gt;[130] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. The Captain's Door slides smoothly open. A pleasant ping indicates it now recognizes you as authorized.

&gt;[131] a
The Captain's Door closes silently behind you.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. You can exit to fore.

&gt;[132] open drawer
You open the desk drawer, revealing the captain's journal.

&gt;[133] take journal
Taken.

&gt;[134] read it
The captain's journal is an electronic diary which requires a password to open.
⇒ For example, say "journal, password walrus" to unlock the journal with the password "walrus".

&gt;[135] journal, password walrus
The journal beeps once to indicate an invalid login.

&gt;[136] journal, password charon
The journal chimes pleasantly and the screen fills with text.

&gt;[137] read journal
[I never thought it would come to this, eavesdropping on someone's personal thoughts.]

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

[My god...]

&gt;[138] f
The Captain's Door opens as you approach, and closes silently behind you.

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

&gt;[139] f

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[140] u

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls, communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

You can see an equipment trunk (closed) here.

&gt;[141] z
Time passes.

A man's voice comes over comms: "Usagi, are you there?"


&gt;[142] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

&gt;[143] tell caller about me
You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

&gt;[144] yes
"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[145] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[146] tell arvax about journal
(the captain's journal)
"Oh, Captain no... We must act fast if we're going to stop what she's put in motion."

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

[What now?]

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Captain's Quarters
Neat and spartan, this cabin is the very model of a small fighting ship's captain's quarters. An impeccably organized desk is against one wall, while a typically spotless bed sits beneath a portrait of this very ship. You can exit to fore.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

You page through the journal, skimming over the boring parts detailing the running of the ship. Eventually you come across something more interesting:

"I screwed up last night. I let them spend the night and I think someone noticed. If this got out my career would be over."

A few pages later:

"I'm being blackmailed. I don't know who, but someone messaged me telling me all they know. They know a lot. They made it clear they expect my 'cooperation'."

Numerous later passages detail this cooperation, ranging from simple intelligence gathering to actively working to harm the Space Authority.

Port-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to starboard.

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull.  It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

You are holding one end of the tether, which is attached to the hook here, and then runs aft.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Crash
An Interactive Disaster by Phil Riley
Release 5 / Serial number 220727 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

You pass into the aft airlock, the outer door closing behind you.


The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[2] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[3] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

⇒ You can enter "hints" at any time for help in progressing in the game.

&gt;[6] p

Port-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to starboard.

&gt;[7] open cabinet
You open the port-side equipment cabinet, revealing an engineering uniform and an Universal Game Emulator.

&gt;[8] x engineering uniform
Colored the traditional mustard yellow of Engineering, it's really a remarkably ugly uniform.

In the engineering uniform is a piece of note paper.

&gt;[9] read paper
Scribbled on the paper is the number 9467.

&gt;[10] type 9467 on keypad
As you press a key, the storage unit starts buzzing continuously. The display lights up with random characters, and you smell the distinct odor of burning wires. The bottom storage drawer pops out a centimeter or two.

You add an item ("fix the storage unit") to your to-do list.

&gt;[11] read list
You have the following items on your to-do list: fix the microwave, fix the cabinet, and fix the storage unit. 

&gt;[12] x storage unit
The storage unit consists of top and bottom drawers, with an attached keypad and display. There is a keyhole under the keypad. The top drawer is closed; the bottom drawer juts out by a couple of centimeters.

&gt;[13] open bottom drawer
The drawer is partially open, but you can't find a purchase on it firm enough to open it.

&gt;[14] x universal game emulator
This device, the Universal Game Emulator, or "UGE", can play any game ever produced for any system.

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[17] read note
Written on the note is "Mail package to Mitchell ASAP".

&gt;[18] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[19] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

You can also see a black trunk (closed) here.

&gt;[20] open trunk
You open the black trunk, revealing a present.

&gt;[21] open present
[I'll go to hell for this, but here goes...]

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bear™. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[22] x bear
Bertie the Bear™ is a massively popular toy. It accepts voice commands, and its eyes, actually advanced optical sensors, can differentiate between individuals. This bear's blindly staring eyes are unnerving.

&gt;[23] x eyes
They're well disguised, but the eyes are clearly top-of-the-line optical sensors that you might see in more serious uses, such as in facial recognition devices.

&gt;[24] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

&gt;[25] take trunk
Taken.

Dropped.

&gt;[29] a
You try to enter the airlock, but the automatic door fails to open for you.
[It's always just opened in the past.]

You add an item ("fix the airlock door") to your to-do list.

&gt;[30] x door
The airlock door is an imposing solid barrier between vacuum and safety. It is colored yellow with red warning symbols on it. Above the door is a panel of electronic components.

&gt;[31] x panel
The component panel is too high.

&gt;[32] stand on trunk
(first closing the black trunk)
You get onto the black trunk.

&gt;[33] x panel
The prominent features of the panel are two optical sensors. One of them has become partially detached and looks broken.

&gt;[34] take broken sensor
You remove the broken sensor from the panel.

&gt;[35] put new sensor in panel
You insert the fresh sensor into the empty socket.
[There. That should do it.]

You cross out an item ("fix the airlock door") on your to-do list.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the blackness of space, speckled with the dying embers of what was once Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

&gt;[37] a
It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
⇒ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.

&gt;[38] turn on boots
You switch the Magnetic boots on.

&gt;[39] a

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[40] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[41] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[42] x suit
A puffy yellow suit with an attached helmet and magnetic boots. The gloves are misshapen things, optimized for carrying weaponry, not precision work. There is a nozzle on the front through which air can be recharged or vented. Lights indicate the boots are currently on. A gauge indicates the suit has 12 units of air left.
[I always wanted one of these.]

⇒ You can vent air by using "vent suit"

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[43] vent suit
You vent a bit of air from your suit. It propels you just a tiny amount toward the hull, but it's enough. One agonizing minute later, you're attached to the hull again.

[Oh thank god! I thought I was a goner.]

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are other exits to aft and port.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

&gt;[47] sit in chair
The nozzles on either side of the chair connect with the suit. After a few moments, the machine emits a pleasant "ping", the nozzles retract, and you stand up.

You hear someone speaking forward of here.

&gt;[48] f

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls, communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the midship door, blocking it.

&gt;[49] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

&gt;[50] tell caller about me
You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

&gt;[51] yes
"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[52] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[53] ask arvax about mulgrew
"Let me guess. She told you I'm a separatist stooge, right? I guess it's time to blow my cover. I've been cultivating that image for several years now to infiltrate Deneb IV. Here. Enter my access code: 'computer, access code 2' and look up 'Operation Dalmatian'."

&gt;[54] ask mulgrew about dalmatian
"Never heard of it. No doubt another of Arvax's lies."

&gt;[55] computer, access code 2

Welcome, Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. Logging you in.

&gt;[56] ask computer about dalmatian

Operation Dalmatian is a top secret operation to infiltrate the Deneb IV separatist movement. The primary operative is Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax, who has been playing double agent to ingratiate himself with the terrorist leadership. Among other successes, he has confirmed that as many as three Space Marine captains are compromised by the separatists, although he has not been able to positively identify these captains.

Captain Mulgrew: "Calling the SS Usagi..."
