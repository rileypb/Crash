Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

Another routine day of drudgery aboard the Stellar Patrol Ship Feinstein. This morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub brush you shine the floor with a diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed cabinet door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

&gt;[12] f
You enter the ship from the airlock. The inner door closes behind you.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[13] u
You climb the la--

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and lies face down on the floor.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

&gt;[14] a
You try to enter the airlock, but the automatic door fails to open for you.
[It's always just opened in the past.]

You add an item ("fix the airlock door") to your to-do list.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[15] u

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

â‡’ You can enter "hints" at any time for help in progressing in the game.
&gt;[16] s

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

&gt;[17] take slippers
As you lean to take the slippers, you notice something under the bed.

&gt;[18] look under bed
You find a black trunk and move it out from under the bottom bunk.

You open the black trunk, revealing a present.

&gt;[21] take present
Taken.

&gt;[22] open it
[I'll go to hell for this, but here goes...]

You rip off the wrapping paper and open the box. Inside is a stuffed bear you recognize as Bertie the Bearâ„¢. You discard the paper and box.

&gt;[23] take eyes
[Am I really going to do this? Yes, yes, I am, apparently.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the blackness of space, speckled with the dying embers of what was once Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

&gt;[34] out
It's dangerous out there. I recommend saving the game first...
â‡’ Use "save" to save the game, or go "out" again to continue without saving.
&gt;[35] out

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[36] f

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

It looks like you could break off a small piece of debris.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[37] s
You attempt to climb over the debris. Just when you think you're over, your foot catches, and you lose your hold. The result: you're floating about a foot from the hull, unable to make contact with your mag boots to pull yourself down. You're barely moving relative to the hull, but you're stuck here. The bright side? You broke down the debris enough that it's no longer a barrier.

[Okay, stay calm. Don't freak out.]

Hull of the Usagi (vacuum, floating)
Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Where there used to be a large embedded chunk of debris blocking the path, now there is a scattering of rubble.

There is a hook set in the hull here.

Your vac suit pings gently to indicate you have expended a unit of air.

&gt;[38] vent air
You vent a bit of air from your suit. It propels you just a tiny amount toward the hull, but it's enough. One agonizing minute later, you're attached to the hull again.

[Oh thank god! I thought I was a goner.]

&gt;[40] in
Welcome back, visitor. I hope your spacewalk was uneventful.

Engineering Airlock
You are in the engineering airlock. Outside, the space to starboard looks so empty and peaceful it's hard to imagine the awful sight astern.

â‡’ astern: behind or toward the rear of a ship, spaceship or aircraft.
&gt;[41] p

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are doorways aft and port, to the engine room and machine room respectively.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

&gt;[42] sit in recharger
The nozzles on either side of the chair connect with the suit. After a few moments, the machine emits a pleasant "ping", the nozzles retract, and you stand up.

&gt;[43] p

Machine Room
The machine room is where the physical work of Engineering takes place; for instance, machining new parts. There is a large counter lined with drawers here, as well as numerous saws, drills, and other pieces of equipment. You can leave to starboard.

There's a hand vac sitting on the counter.

&gt;[44] open drawer
You open the machine room drawers, revealing a small key, a roll of electrical tape, a hex-shaped tool, and a fresh fuse.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[45] take all

Operations Deck
This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the midship door, blocking it.

A man's voice comes over comms: "SS Usagi, come in! Is anyone there?"

[Finally, another person! I'm saved!]

â‡’ By the way... you can get help about speaking to other characters by typing "help speech".â‡’ You might try saying hello.
&gt;[48] move trunk
You push the trunk clear of the door.

&gt;[49] set gravity control to 1
You dial the gravity to 1.

A man's voice comes over comms: "If there's anyone on the Usagi, please respond!"


&gt;[50] press button
The door slides open.

&gt;[51] d

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

&gt;[52] open drawer
You open the kitchen drawer, revealing a knife, a fork, and a spoon.

&gt;[53] take knife

Starboard-Side Crew Quarters
All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

You can also see a cardboard box (empty) and some wrapping paper here.

&gt;[61] get on top bunk
As you clamber up, it looks like there's something wrong with the cabinet door.

&gt;[62] replace screw
You unscrew the old screw and replace it with a new one from your toolbox.

You cross out an item ("fix the cabinet") on your to-do list.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room. It has been turned door-side up.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

&gt;[115] push jl-758 in
You push the brand-new JL-758 to Engineering Deck.

Engineering Deck
The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are doorways aft and port, to the engine room and machine room respectively.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

A device labeled "Suit Recharging Station" is here. It is shaped like a chair with nozzles protruding from either arm.

Galley
This narrow space is barely enough room for two Marines to prepare and eat a meal. There is a counter with a drawer, and two stools, a microwave oven, and a large closet here. Pots and pans hang from hooks in the ceiling. A ladder leads up through the midship door, and you can leave aft.

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

You hear someone speaking above.

Junction
This is a busy place when the ship is populated. To port and starboard are the crew quarters, aft is the closed door to the captain's private quarters, and fore is the galley. A ladder leads down to the staging area.

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

&gt;[121] open door with red card
You slide the red access card through the slot. Nothing happens.
[That's weird. It should at least make a buzz.]

You add an item ("fix the captain's door") to your to-do list.

&gt;[122] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is closed and held fast with a screw.

&gt;[123] open panel
You open the panel, hanging on to the blue screw that held it shut.

The access panel opens to reveal a row of fuses, one of which is blown.

&gt;[124] take blown fuse
Taken.

&gt;[125] put fuse in panel
(the fresh fuse in the access panel)
You put the fresh fuse into the access panel.

&gt;[126] close panel
When you try to close the access panel, the blue screw slips from your grasp, bounces once, rolls, and falls down the ladder well. At the bottom of the ladder, it bounces once more, right through the grill of an air scrubber intake. That screw's long gone.

&gt;[127] close panel
All of your screws are either too big or too small.

&gt;[128] x panel
The access panel is set in the bulkhead to the left of the door. It is open, leaving an empty hole where the screw was.

The panel holds a row of fresh fuses.

â‡’ You might try saying hello.
&gt;[142] z
Time passes.

&gt;[143] hello
(addressing the caller)
You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax -- you can ask the ship computer about me. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

"Yes sir!" you proclaim, despite his lame joke.

"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

&gt;[144] hello
(addressing Captain Jane Mulgrew)
Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

&gt;[145] tell arvax about journal
"I'm afraid I don't have anything to say about that."

&gt;[146] computer, access code 2
Welcome, Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax. Logging you in.

&gt;[147] computer, reboot
Are you sure you wish to reboot?

Beginning reboot. Take all appropriate precautions.

Red alert lights flash throughout the ship.

Below that is a representation of the various inputs and the products created during the fuel injection process. Each input has a touch-sensitive surface which can be used to alter the diagram's settings.

Input 1 is Anti-Helium. Input 2 is unset, so there is no product resulting from inputs 1 and 2. Input 3 isn't set. Input 4 isn't set.
The possible inputs are Anti-Helium, Oganesson, Red Matter, Tachyon Crystals, and Unobtainium. There are two additional possible outputs: Liquid Copernicium and Void Matter.

Tip: Use "substance &gt; input" to set each input. For instance, "Un &gt; 3" sets input 3 to Unobtainium. You may also use "set &lt;input&gt; to &lt;substance&gt;" for the same effect. Use "disconnect &lt;input&gt;" to disconnect an input.

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed cabinet door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

***BOOM***

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and lies face down on the floor.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

[What now?]

All crew members who aren't the captain sleep in this or the opposite-side bunk room. This one sleeps two in a bunk bed, done up with military precision. There is a large cabinet here, stretching almost to the ceiling. It is closed. Mounted in the wall is a crew personal storage unit. The sole exit is to port.

In a shocking lapse of military precision, there is a sticky note attached to the bed post.

A pair of slippers peeks out from under the bed.

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

Outside the Aft Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the aft airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to fore among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

Here the path runs aft to the aft airlock and starboard to the engineering airlock. Your path to starboard is blocked by a piece of debris lodged in the hull. [Whatever happened, this was part of it. It's fortunate it didn't penetrate further into the hull.] It's going to be tough to get over; it doesn't look magnetic, so your mag boots won't stick to it. You'll need to be careful.

The engineering crew is responsible for keeping the physical ship operating. They are in charge of every physical aspect of the ship, from the engines to hull integrity to the life support system.

The engineering deck consists of a large console giving a comprehensive view of the physical status of the ship. There is an airlock to starboard. The operations deck continues forward from here, and there are doorways aft and port, to the engine room and machine room respectively.

You hear someone speaking to fore.

Outside the Engineering Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the engineering airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to port among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the midship door, blocking it.

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax -- you can ask the ship computer about me. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

"Yes sir!" you proclaim, despite his lame joke.

"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room. It has been turned door-side up.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

There is an air scrubber intake in the wall here.

You can also see a banged-up suit and a black trunk (closed) here.

Another routine day of drudgery aboard the Stellar Patrol Ship Feinstein. This morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub brush you shine the floor with a diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.

The alien ambassador from the planet Blow'k-bibben-Gordo ambles toward you from down the corridor. He is munching on something resembling an enormous stalk of celery, and he leaves a trail of green slime on the deck. He stops nearby, and you wince as a pool of slime begins forming beneath him on your newly-polished deck. The ambassador wheezes loudly and hands you a brochure outlining his planet's major exports.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed cabinet door, and then you're off for the day.

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed cabinet door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and lies face down on the floor.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

On the starboard wall is a panel on which is a blue button. Tacked to the panel is the operator's manual for the midship door.

Another routine day of drudgery aboard the Stellar Patrol Ship Feinstein. This morning's assignment for a certain lowly Ensign Seventh Class: scrubbing the filthy metal deck at the port end of Level Nine. With your Patrol-issue self-contained multi-purpose all-weather scrub brush you shine the floor with a diligence born of the knowledge that at any moment dreaded Ensign First Class Blather, the bane of your shipboard existence, could appear.
