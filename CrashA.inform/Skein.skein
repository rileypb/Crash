An Interactive Disaster by Phil Riley

Space Station Gangway
This is the pressurized bridge from Space Station Omicron-5 to the SS Usagi. Behind you is the familiar bulk of the huge station, largest outpost of the Space Authority in Deneb Sector. Before you is the aft airlock of the Usagi, beckoning you in.

[Better get a move on], you think.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. It houses a number of vac suits in an open locker, and various munitions in locked compartments set into the walls. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 
Through the airlock windows you can see the gangway to Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Press any key...

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.

[What now?]

[I think I spit out my gum.]

You grasp one of the eyes and give it a tug, first softly then harder. Eventually it gives and you extract the eye from the bear. Upon examination you discover that the eye is in fact an optical sensor in camouflage. It looks like you didn't pull it carefully enough, however, because the connector at the end has been damaged.

You try again more carefully with the second eye, and manage to produce an undamaged optical sensor.

Outside the Engineering Airlock (vacuum)
You are standing on the hull of the ship, outside the engineering airlock, secured by your vac suit's mag boots. Most of the hull is taken up by the protrusions of various machinery, antennae, radio dishes, and heat sinks. There is a clear path to port among the obstructions. You can also go in to the airlock.

A hook protrudes from the hull next to the airlock door.

This is where all of the support activity for the bridge occurs. There are large consoles for environmental controls (which include gravity, temperature, and pressure), communications, and power systems here. The bridge continues forward from here, and engineering is aft. There is a door set in the floor with a ladder leading through it. Set in the frame of the door is a blue button.

A large equipment trunk lies on the midship door, blocking it.

A man's voice comes over comms: "SS Usagi, come in! Is anyone there?"

You call out "Yes! I'm here! I'm here! What's going on?"

The caller responds, "Ahoy there, SS Usagi, good to hear from you. Seems like you're a bit out of sorts, and we'd like to help you out. But before we get into that, who am I speaking to? Tell me about yourself."

You tell the caller that you're from the repair corps.

"Alright then, Sergeant Screwdriver, I'll fill you in. Space Station Omicron-5 was bombed by separatists from Deneb IV. By some miracle the Usagi was spared the worst of the blast; you were thrown clear of the station. Only problem is now you're hurtling towards New Da Nang, a heavily-populated moon of Deneb II. An impact there would kill not only you but potentially thousands of people more.

 "So we've got some work to do. I'm Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax -- you can ask the ship computer about me. I'm going to try and help you get this ship under control again. First we have to establish, though, what the ship is currently doing. Normally, I'd be able to tap into the ship diagnostics and controls from here on Deneb III, but something seems to have gone wrong. So I'm going to need your help. Are you up to the task?"

[Sergeant Screwdriver, guy thinks he's funny.]

"Yes sir!" you proclaim, despite his lame joke.

"Great, great. Now let's get to work.

 "The first thing I need you to do is reboot the system, using the computer. Once you do that, hopefully I'll be able to access ship controls. You'll have to use my access code: say 'compu--"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice breaks up and another voice comes over comms. "SS Usagi, this is Captain Jane Mulgrew, please come in. Repeat, this is Captain Mulgrew of the SS Usagi, Usagi come in."

[Somebody else?]

Captain Mulgrew responds, "Hello there, Usagi. That's my ship you've got there. Be careful with her.

"We've been listening in and we've heard your communications with Arvax. He had us jammed for a while, but we managed to break through and here we are. Now it's very important that you understand this: Arvax is not your friend. His allegiances lie with Deneb IV, not with the Space Authority. He would like nothing more than to see this ship wipe out a few neighborhoods on New Da Nang.

"So what we need you to do is deny Arvax by shutting down any access to the ship's controls from the outside by invoking the emergency protocols. That will put the ship in a state where we can board and take control of the ship. What do you say? Do you have any questions?"

Master Sergeant R. Mu Arvax's voice comes back over the radio: "You there still, Usagi? I think I lost you for a second."

[Oh no, who should I trust?]

Attention all crew: command functions are offline and the computer is running with decreased capabilities. Full system reboot required.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics, in one formulation, states that disorganization always increases in the absence of some outside force. A corollary is that things will always break down in the absence of someone to fix them. As a member of the repair corps of Space Station Omicron-5, you're that someone.

Your last assignment of the day, on the SS Usagi, a Space Marines fighting ship, looks routine enough. Fix the microwave and a jammed locker door, and then you're off for the day.

Aft Airlock
You are in the aft airlock. Outside is the gangway back to Space Station Omicron-5. Forward leads into the ship.

A pleasant androgynous voice says, "Welcome to the SS Usagi. This is the shipboard computer. Please feel free to call upon me for any information you may need. Use the command 'computer, help' for more information."

Press any key...

A gigantic force grabs the ship, knocking you off the ladder and sending you flying against an aft bulkhead. The inertial dampers are probably all that saved you from being smashed to jelly rather than just banged up. 

Press any key...

Some time later you find yourself lying on the floor of the staging area with a throbbing headache. Gingerly you push yourself to your knees and stand up. The vac suit locker has detached from its mounting and slammed into the airlock door.

[Thank god I wasn't in the way of that.]

Looking outside --

[Holy -- ]

[Where's the station?].

Where Space Station Omicron-5 was, is now an expanding sphere of rubble, dimly lit by the blue light of far-off Deneb. The rubble is clearly receding behind the ship. [We're moving!]

[How am I going to get off this ship?]

Staging Area
This is the staging area of the ship, where marines prepare for missions. It is adjacent to the aft airlock. Locked compartments set into the walls hold various munitions. A ladder leads up into the rest of the ship. 

An equipment locker is sprawled across the room, with its door to the ground.
 
Through the airlock windows you see the blank space left by the destruction of Space Station Omicron-5.

What looks like part of an engine is stowed in a corner.

A vac suit is here, lying prone as if it were some malformed yellow person knocked unconscious by the shaking of the ship.
